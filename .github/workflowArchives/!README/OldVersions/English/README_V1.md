# Workflow archives

This directory houses the current and old versions of workflows used on GitHub for this project. Currently, there are 50 available continuous integration workloads provided by GitHub (as of 2021 December 15th) and on 2021 December 15th, I added support for all of them, except for all the platform specific ones (Android, iOS) package publishing ones, and one that isn't an actual functional workflow (it is a starter workflow)

Please note that these are the archived copies. The actual workloads are located at [/.github/workflows/](/.github/workflows/)

## Current workflows

The current workflows are installed for SNU (2d) Programming Tools:
