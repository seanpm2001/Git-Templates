as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# Seanpm2001-Robotics.github.io
The website for my robotics projects. 

***

## About

See above. This project is the GitHub pages site for my various robotics projects.

***

## Current issue

I accidentally put bot projects into this projects organizations, they should be somewhere else. Try to ignore them. Robotics is not to be confused with Bot scripts, see [Seanwallawalla Bots](https://github.com/seanwallawalla-bots/) or [Seanpm2001 bots](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Bots/) for my bot script projects.

***

## Project icon

An image of GLaDOS is used as the organization profile picture. I know that this isn't the best example, as GLaDOS is very cynical and dangerous (although she is a fictional character) but my robotics project will not turn out to be evil, I just like the character, and I didn't want to use a different generic robot icon.

***

## Current robotics projects

My current robotics projects include:

[TuxBot Operating System](https://github.com/seanpm2001/TuxBot-OperatingSystem)

* Info

The operating system for TuxBot, a miniature robot that is meant to look like Tux (Linux Mascot) and can do various small tasks. The operating system is of course, Linux based.

[RubbleRobot](https://github.com/seanpm2001/RubbleRobot)

* Info

The operating system and plans for Rubble Robot (name is incomplete) a high-end experimental robot (that I can't afford, due to its $40+ million price tag) that can clean up and remove debris from disaster areas quickly and safely enough to find people and reduce the loss of life of massive disasters. Inspired by the 2021 Miami Florida condo collapse. This robot is designed to move over 10 tons (20000 pounds) of debris per hour, safely.

## Wiki

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## Sponsor info

![SponsorButton.png](SponsorButton.png)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
