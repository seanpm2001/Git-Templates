as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_AndrOpen-Office/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## Biology

### Marine Biology

[View the project directly by clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_MarineBiology/)

### Welcome to the seanpm2001 Marine Biology data repository

This folder is for research documents and media related to marine biology and aquatic life.

I have currently had 3 eras of high level animal care, and 1 lower level

#### The lower level (March 21st 2001-2011)

I have had pets all my life, and have enjoyed their comfort and company. Early on, my family had a few dogs, and we raised chickens from time to time.

I didn't get fish until 2011.

#### The pet shop era (2011-2015)

In 2011, I got my first fish. This is what started a valued piece of my childhood known as the Pet Shop era.

Between 2011 and 2015, I worked on creating a pet store called `PetLand` (the name may have already been taken, and I never sold any of my fish, as I cared for them too much to rid of them.) I constantly tinkered with various fishtanks and various fish, and had a lot of good times. I also took some notes, and made some friends.

Later on, I got a set of geckos. These were the first non-aquatic addition to the pet shop. Unfortunately, my pet shop era ended in 2015, as I began to lose interest, and I donated my Geckos to my middle school homeroom teacher. I continued to have fish in a fishtank.

Despite the empty era, my family got chickens and horses as well. These were taken care of daily (and we still have most of them, but most of the chickens have been replaced)

#### The dry era (2015-March 22nd 2021)

**Originally called:** `Empty Era`. _Dry seems more fitting, as there were less aquatic creatures, so my marine biology was a bit more dry._

Between 2015 and 2021, I still had my fish, and took care of them. They had a pretty good life and they were well cared for, living in a 29 gallon tank, and getting treats. Over time, more and more fish died of cancer and old age, and eventually only 3 fish were left; a Koi I had since 5th grade, and 2 cleaner fish.

On March 15th 2021, my Koi died due to a fishtank cleaning incident. The cause of death was unknown, although it can be narrowed down to 2 causes: old age or shock. It was a very hard day for me. This fish was the oldest fish I had, and was a very social one. He loved the attention of the family when we went to see him, and we fed him pretzels daily, as he liked eating them (we also gave him normal fish food as well) there were some things I wanted to do before he died, but I never got to them.

On March 22nd 2021, my dad bought over a dozen new fish, and a new fishtank. The next day, a huge upgrade to this change was done, which brought me into my second marine biology phase.

#### The Marine Biology age II (March 23rd 2021-present)

After our aquatic life household surpassed 40 residents, I decided to get back into marine biology part-time.

I started getting daily videos of my fish on March 23rd 2021, as my family recently got an abundance of aquatic life, and it inspired me to get back into Marine Biology part-time.

I am now doing research on aquatic life again, and working on finding my older notes.

### Other

#### Theories

##### Single celled Organisms

Humanity really has put a lot of thought into going into outer space, but we have rarely paid attention to exploring the ocean. There is still over 70% of our planet we haven't discovered yet, it is weird how we can go into space and see galaxies so far from us, but we can't go into our own oceans on our own planet.

I was thinking this morning (Wednesday, July 7th 2021) about what is really at the bottom of the ocean. I was thinking that what if we found the original single celled organisms from before animals walked on land? What if they are all still down there? If they are, can they unlock the secrets of life? It would be amazing if these creatures from over a billion years ago were still down there. What could they teach us? We haven't explored the oceans too much yet, so we don't entirely know. Lets start exploring!

### Botany

[View the project by clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_BotanyProject/)

Botany is the study of plant-life. I currently don't have much Botany research (as of July 8th 2021)

### Ornithology

[View the project by clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Ornithology/)

Ornithology is the study of birds. I currently don't have much Ornithology research (as of July 8th 2021)

### Zoology

[View the project by clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Zoology/)

Zoology (/zoʊˈɒlədʒi/) is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον, zōion ('animal'), and λόγος, logos ('knowledge', 'study').

I currently don't have much Zoology research (as of July 8th 2021)

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ssing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
