# Marine video maintenance guide

For family use primarily, you can also use this as a guide to make your own fishtank videos if needed.

## Context

This guide was created on July 28th 2021, as a couple days ago, I realized that while I am gone, I can't get fishtank videos, and I will need someone to fill in for me.

It took me a couple days, but I have finally created a guide on how to do so.

## Duration

I normally record videos of duration between 20 and 120 seconds. I try not to go for too long, as every video I make is over 200 megabytes in size, and my experiment with a 2 minute video took up over 1.1 gigabytes of space.

## Lighting

The video can be done in any lighting. The fishtanks blue light can make for a cool video, as long as you know how to balance it.

Background lights and lighting can cause dusty looking videos. Try to adjust background light before starting.

## Capture

The captured video should focus dominantly on the fishtank and its residents. Try to avoid any other objects (other than fishtank equipment) in your video. Get as little furniture as possible into the video, and don't record with other species present (including humans)

## Audio

Try not to talk during the video. Try to breath as lightly as possible, and don't eat or swallow too much while recording. - These are my strict guidelines

You can do it differently, just don't make it too distracting or inappropriate. Commentary should still be at a minimum, unless you are doing a documentary.

The audio of the fishtank filters, bubbles, and opening fishtank apparatus is allowed.

## Feeding

You can feed the fish during the video. As usual, remember not to overfeed

## Time

You can do the videos any time of the day, as long as you just do it once. Personally, I just do it at nighttime, before bed.
