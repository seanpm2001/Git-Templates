# ///Wikipedia/

This directory is for my personal Wikipedia archive and curated Wikipedia PDF center.

## WikiFull

WikiFull is a copy of the entire Wikimedia project. It will be scraped monthly, as Wikimedia puts out full site archives monthly.

Copies of various versions of Wikipedia will be here, but it won't be hosted through this GitHub project.

Additionally, a Wikipedia archive scraping tool will be here, just so this folder doesn't go to waste on the Git upstream project.

## WikiPDF

WikiPDF is the new special Wikipedia archive I started working on, on Friday, July 23rd 2021, in preparation for an upcoming road trip. Its purpose has been expanded to be a curated list of all the Wikipedia articles I have read, partially, or fully. 

This project is very time consuming, and its contents can't be uploaded yet due to its incompleteness.
