as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Reactop/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

# Reactop
A old idea I had for a series of laptops that run ReactOS (an operating system that runs Windows programs natively, but isn't built on Windows code) I am unsure if I will continue this project.

***

## About

See above

*** 

## Past advertising

In the past, when creating this project, 2 advertisements were produced, which were mediocre and low quality. They were created in 2018, and they don't represent the project as well anymore.

2 variants of the old ad exist, one a USA localization, and the other a Russian localization, due to ReactOS's origins in Russia. These ads were never aired, and are still stored in the seanpm2001 archives.

***

## Stability

As of July 14th 2021, ReactOS is still in beta. Having a Reactop laptop is experimental, and may not be 100% stable. You can still dual-boot into another operating system if needed.

***

## Performance

Compared to Windows Vista 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and 11, ReactOS has much higher performance for a modern laptop and supports various features of Windows NT, and outperforms it in some ways. Reactops are given a minimum of 2 gigabytes of RAM, which is equivalent in speed to running Windows 7 with 16-32 gigabytes of RAM, along with some other major differences. ReactOS is different from Windows, and is not just a fork of Windows (since you can't really fork Windows) it is its own dependant operating system that is a rewrite of many Windows NT features and is much lighter.

Here is a simplified model of the workings of ReactOS.

***

## Dual booting

Due to the issue of ReactOS stability, the Reactop comes pre-loaded with 2 operating systems, ReactOS being the main one, and Kubuntu 20.04 being the second one. Optionally, a 3rd and 4th partition for dual booting is preloaded, it isn't recommended to put Windows 10 or higher on it, due to the issue of Windows 10 and Windows 11 deleting partitions that it doesn't like (especially Linux partitions)

***

## Hardware plans

The Reactop is designed to be a budget laptop that isn't a netbook, and comes with some low-end specs, such as:

* 2-8 gigabytes of RAM

* 512-2048 gigabytes HDD or SSD (HDD and SSD options both can have the same amount of storage, the current minimum is 0.5 TiB, and the current maximum is 2.0 TiB)

* 1280x720 to 1920x1080 screen resolution

* AMD64 processor at 2.4-3.6 GhZ

* AMD GPU (an NVidia option will never be available)

* Bluetooth support

* 4 USB 3.0 ports

* 2 USB C ports

* 2 USB 4.0 ports

* 20000-50000 mAh battery (equivalent to 24-60 hours of idle usage)

* Operating system 1: ReactOS 0.4

* Operating system 2: Kubuntu 20.04

* Operating system 3: Blank partition

* Operating system 4: Blank partition

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Reactop/wiki/)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
