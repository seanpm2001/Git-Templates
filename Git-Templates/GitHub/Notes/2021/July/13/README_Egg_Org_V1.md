as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of June 23rd 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_ProgrammingTools/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

# Egg_Org
Egg Org is a free and open source alternative to Egg inc. Completely in-app purchase and advertisement-free. Development focus is currently only for Linux, BSD and BSD/Darwin. Windows, and otherOS support coming soon. 
 
***

## About

See above. Egg Org is an expansion of Egg Inc, and is a free and open source alternative, with no in-app purchases. It expands the game by changing many things, and allowing for different types of birds and reptiles to be used on farms, along with new quests, new content, new graphics, and more.

***

## Builds

There are no public builds of this game yet.

The website currently uses the Slate theme. If you are not on the website, the website can be found by [clicking/tapping here](https://github.com/Egg-org/Egg-org/).

***

## Game icon

This game currently doesn't have its own icon, so it uses the Egg Inc icon as a placeholder.

I intend for the game to have a egg like icon in the future, and not a bird, as this game will encompass so many different birds, but also reptiles and other egg-laying animals.

***

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
