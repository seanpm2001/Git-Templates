### Can't upload 4 videos

Unfortunately, the 4 videos that were included in the advertising kit can't be uploaded to GitHub due to the 25 Megabyte upload limit.

The 4 videos include:

> 1. `Russian Reactop R20 commercial version 1 with sound .mp4` - 28,880,448 bytes (28.88 Megabytes)

> 2. `Russian Reactop R20 commercial version 1 no sound .mp4` - 29,628,113 bytes (29.62 Megabytes)

> 3. `USA Reactop R20 commercial version 1 no sound .mp4` - 33,194,439 bytes (33.19 Megabytes)

> 4. `USA Reactop R20 commercial version 1 with sound .mp4` - 31,361,580 bytes (31.36 Megabytes)

This is now another one of the issues piling up that I can't fix. I am up past ~30 now.
