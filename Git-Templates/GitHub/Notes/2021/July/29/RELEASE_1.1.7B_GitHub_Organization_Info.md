# Version 1.1.7B - July 25th 2021

## V1.1.7B

### Changes:

This is the fifty-fourth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 629 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 52nd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V51 and not V52. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 4 days late, as I have been having difficulty performing recently. I finally got to it on July 29th 2021.
