## Darigold proposal

I have stated this many times privately, but I feel I need to explain it publicly: Darigold needs their own chocolate/strawberry milk mixes. It would be good competition, and due to the justified growing opposition against Nestle, I am sure it can get a foothold. This would help me alternate from the 2 Nestle products I can't get away from (the abstinance failed due to family matters, and I am now going back to normal, but still protesting Nestle, as there is no other option)

Darigold chocolate and strawberry milk mix is a good idea, and it would be more ethical than the Nestle mix, as Darigold is far less openly evil, if at all evil (I don't see any opposition towards them)
