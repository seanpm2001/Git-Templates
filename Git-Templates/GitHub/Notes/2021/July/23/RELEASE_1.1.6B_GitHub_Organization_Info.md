# Version 1.1.6B - July 22nd/23rd 2021

## V1.1.6B

### Changes:

This is the fifty-second release of this project. It contains the basic data for 626 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 52nd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V51 and not V52. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This release came a day late, as I ran out of time last night, and didn't get to it until nearly 24 hours later. This release represents the data for Thursday, July 22nd 2021, and not Friday, July 23rd 2021.
