## V0.0.0.1Alpha

### About

This is version 1 of the NUNIX operating system for the NUNIX project. It is far from complete, and doesn't have intended functionality yet, as there currently is no way to connect to the human brain digitally.

This version is mainly just to get some ideas down, and to officially start the project and its foundation. This version is not fully functional.
