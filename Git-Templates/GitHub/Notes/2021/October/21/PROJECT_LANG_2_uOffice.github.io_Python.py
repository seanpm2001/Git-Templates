# I have decided to have the second project language for this project (uOffice) be Python, as Python is a good language to use for this purpose, as I prefer its usage. I don't know of any open source office suites like this written in Python, so it is also a first. It will be supplemented with other languages as well. It is also the main language used in the original uOffice project.
