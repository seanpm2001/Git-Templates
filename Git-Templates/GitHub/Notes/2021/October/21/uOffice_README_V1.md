Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/uOffice/uOffice/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

## History

This project has a decent length history so far.

### Pre-history

Early development of this project started as a proprietary Java program around 2018. At the time, I decided that proprietary was the way to go until I made enough money, then I would make it open source. It didn't develop too far like this. It is now open source, just private (technically it was always open source, as I didn't lock down the source code at all) I then discovered the enormous value of open source. I am still searching for the original Java prototype.

The project was rewritten later that year in Python. It didn't go too far again.

On 2020 June 23rd, the project was moved to GitHub, and it was then abandoned for over a year.

### Alpha history

On 2021 Thursday, October 21st, I took interest in the project again, and began to modernize it. Its previous specifications were overwritten with new, refined ones (2 exabytes -> 16 exabytes, renaming all the office programs, removed 8, 16, and 32 bit support) although the original unmodified source code still remains public.

I also created a website for the project, along with a snapcraft project. Its `README.md` file was modernized, and lots of development planning went into the project today.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
