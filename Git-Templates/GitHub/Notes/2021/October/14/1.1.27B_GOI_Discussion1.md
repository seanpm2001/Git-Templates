# Version 1.1.27B - 2021 October 14th

## V1.1.27B

### Changes:

This is the Ninety-second release of this project. It contains the basic data for 671 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 91st release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V92 and not V93. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

See below for more changes.
