# Naming

This project is named AUTOMATE-2001, as it was a good simple name I came up with. It stands for automation 2001, or Automate Seanpm2001. It is named in the retro style of 80s/90s/early 2000s science fiction and software naming principles, such as Windows 2000, Microsoft Office 2000, DISCO-TRON 3000, and such. It uses an odd number, as the 2000, 3000, etc. naming is pretty common, and I wanted to use an odd number that reflects my birth year and username.

## How to spell it in your fork

Here are instructions for how to name the project if you are forking it.

It is spelled with all caps, like so `AUTOMATE-2001` but referring to it can be done in any caps, as long as you include the words `Automate` and `2001` next to each other (you can even refer to it in the mocking way, like `AuToMaTe-2001` you cannot replace the `0` with `O` or other letters. The words have to remain the same. You also don't need a hyphen between the 2 words, you can also either use a space, an underscore, or just connect the words, like so: `AUTOMATE2001`

If your fork is at least 50.01% different (in terms of GUI, source code, file structure, file names, and documentation (combined)) than the original project, you can change the name to whatever you want, but you have to give credit to the original project regardless.
