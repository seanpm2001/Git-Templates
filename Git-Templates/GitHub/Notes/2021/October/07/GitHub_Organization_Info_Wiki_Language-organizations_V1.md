# Usage of language organizations

I starred making organizations dedicated to the sorting and easy access of projects written in specific languages. Organizations are used as a tool for me to give projects and project categories their own platform. I fork projects to organizations based on their language usage.

## Mixed decision

I made a decision on May 14th 2021 to mix the language topics together. I had a nearly week long debate with myself on if projects (such as Python) could fit with HTML or other projects and be in multiple language categories. I decided in favor, and now each topic will contain projects with non-dominant related languages.

## Markup languages

Usage of low-level markup languages have to be limited, as they are languages that are expected to significantly go up in usage, and markup languages can be used alongside any language, so their usage should be limited.

The common low-level markup languages so far include Markdown, YAML, XML, MediaWiki, Diff, and ReStructuredText. HTML is not included, as it is a higher level language that can also utilize JavaScript, Ruby, CSS, PHP, and more.
