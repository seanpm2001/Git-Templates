# SNU Organizations

I starred making organizations dedicated to the sorting and easy access of sub-projects within the SNU website project starting in 2021 May, when I was creating massive amounts of organizations for all my projects.

SNU (Social Network Ultimate) is a website project started in 2018 that aims to be the ultimate social media platform. It originally was going to be a single website, but over time in its development, it became fully open source, fully public, and expanded to also be the ultimate alternative, meaning you can easily alternate from one website framework to another.

SNU encompasses a large range of subjects and categories, and is feature rich, with high levels of customization and portability. Originally, there were 2 organizations for SNU, the first one being `snu-development` for general development of all the sites projects, and the second one being `snu-programming-tools` for all subprojects of the SNU programming framework, an online IDE collection for every programming/markup/stylesheet/etc computer language.

There are 5 organizations for the dimensional preferences for SNU, from the joke domain `SNU-0D` to `SNU-4D` (2D is the most common one, as it is in the direct middle for functionality)

There are then organizations for several SNU projects from the SNU directory structure (SNU 3.x) which was made public and started being uploaded to GitHub in 2020 when the project finally went from PFOSS to FOSS.

There are over 100 SNU organizations, most of them have the same icon. There are no SNU organizations for individual SNU Programming Tools IDE projects, as it is not needed to that, and would be incredibly excessive and difficult to do.
