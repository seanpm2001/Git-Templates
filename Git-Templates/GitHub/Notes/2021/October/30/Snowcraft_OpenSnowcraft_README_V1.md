# OpenSnowcraft

OpenSnowcraft is the open source (recreation) version of Snowcraft. It is designed to be used with Ruffle-rs, and is written in ActionScript 3 to preserve the original design.

## Improvements

* Being able to adjust the game resolution past 360p/480p (supporting displays up to 16K)

* Being open source

* A snow fort building mode

* Selecting different levels, and customizing difficulty

* Changing team colors

* Multiplayer mode via LAN and WLAN

* [Suggest a feature](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Snowcraft/issues/)
