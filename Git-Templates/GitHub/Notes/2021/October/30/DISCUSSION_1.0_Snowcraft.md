This is the first release of this Snowcraft mirror project. It contains the data for the original game, some documentation, and no more.

This is a mirror of the old flash game. It currently only runs on Windows. It may not work on certain versions of Windows 10, and is incompatible with Windows 11, since it is a 32 bit program. It is recommended to run this game in a virtual machine.
