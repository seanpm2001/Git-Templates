# Audio only

See prior notice about the songs not being included.

Once you obtain the audio files, place them in the folder/directory that contains their format.

## Notes

The program will decide which MP3 file to read, you can include MP3 V0 or MP3 V320

AAC is actually M4A

There is no harm if you upload the wrong files to the wrong directory or rename them, the game will simply not play them. Nothing will be lost. If something does go wrong, you have a dangerous/modified version of the game, and you can re-download the songs from Bandcamp, or find the zip files and unzip them again, trusted you still have them/access to your Bandcamp account. I am not responsible for the loss of files, but I am really sorry if you were to lose your files like this. Unfortunately, there is nothing I could do.
