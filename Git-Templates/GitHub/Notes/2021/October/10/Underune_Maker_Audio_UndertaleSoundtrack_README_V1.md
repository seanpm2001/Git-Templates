# Undertale soundtrack

For copyright reasons, I cannot include the Undertale soundtrack here. You can listen to it on a video hosting site like YouTube, or you can buy the full high quality version and support the creator (Toby Fox) by purchasing it from Bandcamp.

[Full OST Link](https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/album/undertale-soundtrack/) - 101 songs, although even after purchasing, tracks past 77 are hidden. Download the audio to listen to the last 24 songs.

[Beta OST link](https://tobyfox.bandcamp.com/album/undertale-demo-ost/) - 16 songs, 15 of them are in the full OST in the above link, except for 1 (empty house) which is a slowed down version of fallen down.

Alternatively, you can also buy the game on Steam and copy the files before/after playing the game.
