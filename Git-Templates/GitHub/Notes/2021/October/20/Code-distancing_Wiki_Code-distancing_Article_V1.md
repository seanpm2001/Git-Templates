# Code distancing

Code distancing is the practice of distancing your source code with 6 line breaks/indents to protect it from the [CODEVID-19](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/CODEVID-19/) virus. It is similar to [Social distancing/Physical distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/wiki/Social-distancing/) the requirement is that code is 6 line breaks apart. Take this C hello world program for example:

```c
# include <stdio.h>






int main(void)






{






    printf("hello, world\n");






}
```
