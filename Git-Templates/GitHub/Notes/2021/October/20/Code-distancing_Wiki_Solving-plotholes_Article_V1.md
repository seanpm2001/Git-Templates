# Solving plotholes

## Welcome to plotholes

This is the place where possible plotholes in the CODEVID-19 story are discussed, and go solved or unsolved. I got a bit creative with this project, I tried, but it may not be perfect.

Please remember that this project is _satire_. I feel like it would be pretty obvious to most people that this project is a big joke, but I have to put a disclaimer.

This page goes over all the current solved and unsolved plotholes with this projects story.
