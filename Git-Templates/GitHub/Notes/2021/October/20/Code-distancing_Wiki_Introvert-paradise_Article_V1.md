# Introvert paradise

COVID-19 is a paradise situation for introverts. Introverts before the pandemic tried to get away from it all, but just couldn't. Now that it is acceptable to wear a mask and dark sunglasses, you hardly have to show your face. There are also less people to communicate with, and it is socially acceptable to stay home for weeks/months on end.
