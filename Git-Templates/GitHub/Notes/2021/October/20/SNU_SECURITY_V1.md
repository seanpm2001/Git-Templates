# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a part of the SNU web framework project, and its security issues should also be mentioned elsewhere in the SNU community as well. This is the core of the SNU community. If you have an issue with another part of SNU, mention it there as well. For here, please label issues with the (security) label. DO NOT REPORT ZERO DAY VULNERABILITIES PUBLICLY.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

Other security currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)
