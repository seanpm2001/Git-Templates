# 3D mode (SNU)

3D mode is a high functioning mode of SNU that allows for 3D graphics, images, text, video, audio, VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) for users who want extra, they can choose [4D mode](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/wiki/4D-mode/) for 4 dimensional graphics, such as cubes becoming tesseracts. Although this mode is not distinguishable to the human eye, it is 1 step above 3D mode.

3D mode is the 4th level of dimensional modes of SNU. It supersedes [2D mode](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/wiki/2D-mode/), which doesn't support 3D graphics. 3D mode can also be used with 3D devices, and 3D glasses, although if the device doesn't support 3D graphics, it will still be more 3D.

3D mode comes at a higher memory cost than 2D mode. 2D mode is the middle mode, and 3D is the highest mode with new features.
