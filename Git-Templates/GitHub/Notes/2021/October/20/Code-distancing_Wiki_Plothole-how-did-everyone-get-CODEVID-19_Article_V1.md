## Possible plothole: how did all the programming languages get CODEVID-19

These programming languages were code distancing, so how did they get CODEVID-19?

Simple:

These programming languages come into contact with hundreds, thousands, and sometimes millions of programmers daily, some of which tested positive for COVID-19. The programmers can distance from others, but once COVID-19 transfers through the real world to the digital one, it becomes CODEVID-19, and many programmers are unaware of this. Unfortunately, there currently is no fix for this, as the current computer firewalls aren't designed to protect against this, and there are times where firewalls can be a problem. Luckily, code cannot die from CODEVID-19, but it can rot and become inefficient.
