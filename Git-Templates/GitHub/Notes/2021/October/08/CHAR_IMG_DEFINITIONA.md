# Original character image definition

My original definition of a character image before I finally realized how they fully work is listed here. It is still a possibility that other people may experience the older variant and not the newer variant.

Here is an overview from the original definition

## Overview

Character images (can be shortened to: char imgs, char img, character img, char image, charimg, etc.) is a mental process my brain supports that allows easy manipulation of different characters/people/animals (fictional and real) where the personality and background is emulated to my mental set. This affects the way I do things, but most of the time only internally. Strong character images can effect me externally.

It only takes a maximum of 1 minute and 50 seconds to develop a character image completely. It takes as little as 2 seconds to develop a character image.

## Codes

Notes: The order of codes goes as such:

[1] Character name [2] Category code [3] Effect level (1-8 = normal, 9-16 = medium, 17-24 = high, 25-32 = maximum effect level)

.ybind32 - This is an extremely rare code for maximum strength character images that only affect me internally

.nobind32 - This is a code for strong character images that affect me both internally and externally.

.anime - This is a category code. It is used as the second code in the sequence, and is for Anime/Manga related character images

.vg - This is a category code. It is used for video game related character images

.ppl - This is a category code. It is used for real people related character images

.seas3 - This is a category code. It is used for season 3 (Autumn) mood character images

This section needs to be re-worked.

## Effects

Certain character images can be incompatible some bad side effects include:

> Nausea

> Mental overload

> Stress

> Extreme discomfort

> Shame

Some positive side effects include:

> Better mood

> Being more peppy

> Increased productivity

> Feeling of power

> Reduction of pain.

## Incompatibility

When a character image is incompatible, it may put off side effects. I currently don't know how a character image becomes incompatible.

## Evil-personalities

Evil personalities can form, but depending on your moral standards, the evil will be stripped out of it. Unfortunately, even with the evilness stripped out, character images for the worst people, such as Hitler, Stalin, etc. may form and are still not good to have active. When you get to this point, you should try to replace them with a different, less-evil character image.

For me, these images have never lasted more than an hour, as I get rid of them pretty quickly.

## Duration

The effect of a character image depends on its duration since the last switch. Character images can only change if they are forgotten, or are manually changed.

My current longest running Character images (as of March 11th 2021)

GLaDOS (Portal 2 .vg) 600+ days

Wheatley (Portal 2 .vg) 584+ days

Dr. Zomboss (Plants vs. Zombies .vg) 422+ days

Non-existant (null .corrupt) 364+ -> 1800+ days

Aqua Sama (Konosuba .anime) 4+ days

## Questions

Current questions I have about character images:

1. Is this very common? (probably not)

2. Can character images be a form/be a part of Dissociative Identity Disorder/oldterm: Multiple Personality Disorder?
