# Halloween Assistant

## 2021 October 31st plans

### Celebrating

Despite not being able to give out candy this year due to the pandemic and lack of visitors, I wanted to celebrate Halloween this year. This project is one of my ways to celebrate. The other way was watching Halloween Movies for 2 nights, converting my Halloween music today to different formats, and listening to Halloween music.

### Structure

2 main directories:

#### Trick

For general tricks, and other resources (pumpkin carving, advice, music, other ideas)

#### Treat

For candy/treat management

### Trick direcotry

Trick/Pumpkin carving

Trick/Halloween tricks (come up with some to add in)

I had a really awesome neighbor growing up who was a real partyman. On Halloween, he would do the part of Halloween most people don't do, which is tricking people. You would try to trick him, or he would try to trick you before you would get candy. He really was a nice guy.

### Treat manager

Treat/CandyManager

Helps you manage candy

Options to exclude Nestle candy

Trick or treaters should get a real treat if they come to your place. They should be able to have a selection of treats to choose from if you really love Halloween. Some people may not be able to have chocolate, some people may not be able to have certain kinds of sugar, the choice should be theirs, if you are up to it.

### Challenge

Challenge: write the project in Boo (no other languages, just Boo)
