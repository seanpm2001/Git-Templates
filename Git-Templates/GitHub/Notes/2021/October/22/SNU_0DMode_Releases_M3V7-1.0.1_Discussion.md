# Milestone 3 version 7 (1.01) 0D mode of SNU

## M3V7-1.0.1

### About

This is the second version of SNU 0D mode. It succeeds version 1, which was originally uploaded to GitHub on Sunday, May 31st 2020.

0D mode is a very basic mode and doesn't have much functionality, nor does it need much improvement. It is just a filler mode

This release attempts to finalize the polishing for my current set of GitHub standards. It is a bigger package now, but it is still relatively very small.

### Changes

* Added support for `AUTHORS` `CREDITS` `COPYING` `INSTALL` `MAKEFILE` `.gitignore` `.gitattributes` and .editorconfig` files

* Added an external directory, that houses the ProjectWiki, and the release history

* Archived the first release

* Added a project language file (HTML5)

* Added a minimal package (over 50x smaller than the main project)

* Added 3 preview screenshots

* Updated the ProjectWiki

* Added support for the RepoData archive

* Added support for the pull request archive directory

* Added a basic security policy

* No other changes in this release
