# Vegetarian test results 2021

## Vegetarianism conditional surrender

I am sorry to say this, but my vegetarianism is ending soon. There has been an ethics vs. Health argument in my head for some time (less than 1 week) and health won. I already have a severe eating disorder, and by cutting out meat, I severed my health badly. Until plant-based meat can replace the taste and smell of the 10 foods, I am likely not switching back again. I had to do this for my own health. I am truly sorry.

I am now a carnivore again, but I plan to become a vegetarian again in the future when plant-based meat technology improves. When that happens, the change will for sure be permanent. I lasted 239 days (2021 February 15th to 2021 October 22nd) before this message, but I still have not gone back to eating meat yet.

My common cold was the final pushing point that got rid of my vegetarianism, as I became hungry again for the first time in months. It caused a lot of reflection.

The following foods are being added back to my diet:

1. Beef jerky

2. Cheeseburger bigbites

3. Chicken nuggets (McDonald's)

4. Chicken nuggets (Wendy's)

5. Beef hotdogs

6. Pork bacon

The following items will be experimented with (and also possibly added back to my diet):

1. Panda Express: Orange chicken

2. McDonald's: Hamburger (ketchup only)

3. Smokies (???)

4. Popcorn chicken

And the following items will be dropped:

1. Chicken nuggets (Jack-in-the-box)
