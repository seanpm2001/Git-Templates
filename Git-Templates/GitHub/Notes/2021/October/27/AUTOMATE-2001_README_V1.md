as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001/AUTOMATE-2001/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# AUTOMATE-2001
A tool to help me automate tasks and standards across thousands of projects. Designed for personal use, but it can be used for your use as well.

***

## About

See above. This is a personal project for easing the automation of common or repetitive repository tasks en masse, instead of manual, and one at a time. The project has also been adapted for usage by other people, provided they have a similar workflow.

***

## Wiki

[Click/tap here to view this projects Wiki](https://github.com/AUTOMATE-2001/AUTOMATE-2001/wiki/)

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

***

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started on 2021, Saturday, October 23rd at 6:24 pm as an attempt to solve an ongoing project maintenance project. I decided that certain tasks should be automated, and after I developed the idea and name, I started development. The project received some development on this day.

### Alpha history

This project received continued development on 2021, Sunday, October 24th. It received further JSON support, a total of 7 project language files, the basis for automation, an improved set of guidelines, and increased documentation.

On 2021, Monday, October 25th, the first release was published a little late. The project also received its own GitHub organization. Development continued today, and documentation was heavily increased.

On 2021, Tuesday, October 26th, this project received its second release, but didn't receive too much development time.

On 2021, Wednesday, October 27th, the project had significant documentation improvements, and received its own website. It got a significant improvement to its main `README.md` file.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Security

[Click/tap here to view the security file for this project](/SECURITY.md)

### Supported Versions (security)

This project is still in its early stages, and none of the versions are currently supported for security, as the program is not fully functional yet, and has not been tested fully.

For general security vulnerabilities, use the `security` label and start your issue title with `[SECURITY]`. Remember to not publicly post critical/zero day vulnerabilities, see more on this below.

## Version history (security)

| Version | Supported?         | Support status |
| ------- | ------------------ |-----------------|
| v2021.10.24 (nightly)   | :x: | Old version, not supported |
| v2021.10.25 (nightly)   | :white_check_mark: | Current version, supported |
| > v2021.10.25 (nightly) & > 2021 October 24th   | :white_check_mark: | Current version set, supported |
| v????    | :x: | NOT YET RELEASED |

## Reporting a Vulnerability (security)

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

## Dependencies (security)

Dependency problems aren't very bad. This project uses 7 different languages:

- [x] JSON

- [x] JavaScript

- [x] Python

- [x] QML

- [x] Vala

- [x] C#

- [x] Shell (BASH)

You can still report dependency problems, but dependencies usually won't be updated unless they get too old (5+ years before the most recent release) or they aren't common enough to download anymore. The current dependencies this project has include:

- [x] JSON ? (the program will work with any stable version of JSON)

- [x] JavaScript 1.8 (although the program will still run with any version of JavaScript prior to 1.8)

- [x] Python 3.7.2 (although the program will still run with any version of Python prior to Python 3.0)

- [x] QML 1.0 (although the program will still run with any version of QML prior to 1.0, and it can be bumped up if needed)

- - [x] QTQuick 2.2 (for QML rendering, although it can be bumped up if needed)

- [x] Vala 0.40 (although the program will still run with newer versions of Vala, including the latest version (as of 2021 Wednesday October 27th) which is 0.52.4

- [x] C# 5.0 (although the program will still run with any version of C# prior to 4.0, and it can also be bumped up if needed)

- [x] BASH shell 5.0 (althouh the program will still run with any version of BASH shell from 3.0 or higher, and it can also be bumped up if needed)

### Other security info

Other security info currently isn't available. If there are any further questions, @ me privately on GitHub. [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

***

## Community theme

This software development community is themed around the 2001: A Space Odyssey novel series and film series. Its community will include references to these topics, similar to how the Python community is based around Monty Python. As such, HAL 9000 is the current placeholder icon for this project.

***

## General description

A tool to help me automate tasks and standards across thousands of projects. Designed for personal use, but it can be used for your use as well.

***

## Confirm automation

_Should this project be done manually?_ **Absolutely NOT** (I have already spent hundreds of hours on it, but there is still too much left to do manually)

_Would it take at least 4x more time to do the task manually?_ **YES**

_Would automation save time?_ **Most definitely**

_Extra: How much time do you think you would save from automation?_ **At least 4000 hours across 2+ years**

INSTALL (Insert a template)

Create: /OldVersions/INSTALL/`<language>`/1/1-100/INSTALL_V1

**These files have unique file icons under UNIX-like systems, and do not need file extensions. Adding a file extension would remove the unique icon, although adding numbers to the end of the file name does not affect it, so long as there are no punctuation characters, especially `.` (as of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with GNOME 3.36.1)**

***

## Extra features

Can you get the AUTOMATE-2001 project to automate itself?

Call attention to projects with missing data (social preview image, etc.) and offer a way to replace/add them via the AUTOMATE-2001 API

***

## Similar projects

This project is not to be confused with my other automation projects:

[Backup Automation Build Bot Y (BABBY)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Backup-Automation-Build-Bot-Y) - This is a backup automation tool. It automates data backups.

_No other similar projects to list._

***

## AUTOMATE-2002

Projects forked from this project can be referred to as `AUTOMATE-2002` it is a joke label.

***

## Naming

This project is named AUTOMATE-2001, as it was a good simple name I came up with. It stands for automation 2001, or Automate Seanpm2001. It is named in the retro style of 80s/90s/early 2000s science fiction and software naming principles, such as Windows 2000, Microsoft Office 2000, DISCO-TRON 3000, and such. It uses an odd number, as the 2000, 3000, etc. naming is pretty common, and I wanted to use an odd number that reflects my birth year and username.

### How to spell it in your fork

Here are instructions for how to name the project if you are forking it.

It is spelled with all caps, like so `AUTOMATE-2001` but referring to it can be done in any caps, as long as you include the words `Automate` and `2001` next to each other (you can even refer to it in the mocking way, like `AuToMaTe-2001` you cannot replace the `0` with `O` or other letters. The words have to remain the same. You also don't need a hyphen between the 2 words, you can also either use a space, an underscore, or just connect the words, like so: `AUTOMATE2001`

If your fork is at least 50.01% different (in terms of GUI, source code, file structure, file names, and documentation (combined)) than the original project, you can change the name to whatever you want, but you have to give credit to the original project regardless.

***

## Lifesaver

### Why this project is a lifesaver

I used the label `life-saver` for this project. It is not in reference to the candy, it is in reference to how it will save you from a life of manual, repetitive work via automation (if you have enough projects, it definitely is a life saver due to how much time it will save you)

***

## GitHub automation

### General-GitHub-automation

This is the library for GitHub automation. It is designed for the personal use of [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) but it can work for other people as well, provided you do the same tasks as me.

It is currently written in JSON, JavaScript, and Python. This is a collection of tools to ease the maintenance of GitHub repositories.

[API](/GitHub/API/) - For interacting with the GitHub API

> [Discussions](/GitHub/API/Discussions/) - For the automation of GitHub discussions

> [RepoData](/GitHub/API/RepoData/) - For the automation of GitHub repository data backups.

[Pages](/GitHub/Pages/) - For keeping GitHub pages active, and not letting the site become stale and unusable.

**More automation tools coming soon.**

### GitHub-Pages-automation

This is a script that houses a tool to automate the process of GitHub pages activity. Once every month, it adds an entry to a text file, so that the page will be re-indexed, so that the site won't become unstable and unusable due to the environment expiring.

There are already many tools to do this, I decided to include my own, as it is so simple to do.

### API sets

There are 3 separate API sets

1. QT API: A styled wrapper for QT, written in QML, JSON, and Python.

2. GTK API: A styled wrapper for GTK, written in Vala, JSON, and Python.

3. Vanilla Windows API: A styled wrapper for unmodified/classic Windows, written in C#, JSON, and Python.

More graphical API sets may be added in the future.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM.
