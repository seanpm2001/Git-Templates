[FEATURE REQUEST] Add support for the Whirlpool Galaxy (Messier 51) #4

### [FEATURE REQUEST] Add support for the Whirlpool Galaxy (Messier 51)

I plan to start adding more parts of space for the user to explore through feature requests. There are so many cool things in the Galaxy, so I am starting with some of the best ones that we know of. I have already requested:

* Boötes void

* Barnard Objects

* Andromedia Galaxy

I have recently found out about Messier 51, which is better known as the Whirlpool Galaxy, and it re-sparked my interest in this project.
