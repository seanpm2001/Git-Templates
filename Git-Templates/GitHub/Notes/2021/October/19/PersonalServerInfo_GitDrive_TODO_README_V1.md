# Todo

My todo list for starting and maintaining the GitDrive project

- [ ] Get questions answered on version control on an external storage device

- [ ] Create thousands of repositories for every major file sector on your external hard drive file system

- [ ] Start the sorting and management process

- [ ] Expand to multiple drives

- [ ] Talk about the results, how it went, and the experience

- [ ] Release some software for management of VCS on external storage

## Notes

Having repositories for each big piece of data will be SO so helpful in managing my files

Repositories are likely not going to go on GitHub before (or possibly after) May 15th 2040 for size and purpose reasons, though I am not excluding this option. I don't know how I would do this though.
