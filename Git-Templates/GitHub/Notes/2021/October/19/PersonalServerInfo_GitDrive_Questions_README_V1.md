# Questions about Git usage on an external hard drive/solid state drive

These are my questions related to usage of Git for mass-storage purposes.

## Git and binary files

How well does Git work with binary files, and is there any reason why doing this wouldn't be a good idea?

## Git and large files (1 MB binary-40+ GB binary)

How well does Git manage mass quantities of large binary files (between 1 megabyte and 40+ gigabytes each) and should I do something different?

## Installing Git § On an external hard drive

How do you install Git onto an external storage device? Is this possible?

Can Git maintain all 10 terabytes of a hard drive?

## Internet

Git doesn't connect to the Internet by default, right?

If so, how do you disable Internet telemetry in Git?

## Corruption

The Git repository won't lock up and corrupt data, right?

Should I do something in case of project corruption other than the 3-2-1 rule?

## Other version control systems (if Git is not possible)

Is this idea of using Git to control external storage a bad idea? Should I do something else?

Is a different version control system like Mercurial, other recommended?
