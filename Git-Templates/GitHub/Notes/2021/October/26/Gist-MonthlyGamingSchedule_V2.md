# Gaming schedule (monthly)

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

**Origin:** On Saturday, October 24th 2020, I had to set a schedule to limit my gaming times. I went on a hiatus that lasted over half the month, and then began to return to weekly games, as I was already overloaded with the previous schedule with just 60% of the games.

I have decided to split non-daily games into time slots on certain days. My new limit is 0.5-4.5 hours of gaming a day, 1 hour limit on shooting games (included into total) some game days last more than 4.5 hours, but I try to quit before they get that long.

In February of 2021, a game (Idle Miner Tycoon) was found to be eating way too much time, so a new monthly schedule was created. It currently houses this one game, which is played on the first Tuesday of each month.

The monthly schedule was abandoned on 2021 September 5th when I cut out the only monthly game from the schedule due to time concerns and lack of interest.

This article is about the monthly schedule

## Notes

Gameplay is photographed as part of my journaling project, and for stock imagery. Ads are photographed too.

I originally played on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge from 2016 to November 12th 2020. As of November 13th 2020, I began transitioning gameplay away from the old S7 edge to a new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I got on November 12th 2020. I really like the phone, there is only 1 part of it I consider a downgrade, which is that I went from a screen resolution of 2560x1440 (horizontal, 1440p) 1440x2560 (vertical, 1440p) to 2000x1080 (horizontal, 1080p) 1080x2000 (vertical, 1080p) the only game I still actively play on my old phone is Jewels, because it isn't compatible with Android 10.0, and I want to max out my score on it before abandoning my old S7 edge

Starting on November 19th 2020, I began to play Tiny Death Star again. As the game proves functional and fun, I have decided to turn it into a weekly thing. I will be playing this game every Friday. The first time I played on the weekly schedule was Friday, November 20th 2020.
