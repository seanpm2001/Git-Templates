# Version 0.1.3 - 2021 October 28th update

## V0.1.3

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub, and the first update in 418 days. It is also the nineteenth update to be made on Linux. This release highlights over a year of change, and a lot of progress have been made. This is no longer a pre-release, it isn't really much of a software piece anyway, other than a basic web app.

I haven't been creating new releases with every day of change, I am going to try and fix that, starting with this release (again).

This update changes some things, including:

- [x] Added thousands of new playlists

- [x] Added hundreds of new notes

- [x] Added support for various playlist types

- [x] Added support for a security policy

- [x] Added support for a RepoData archive

- [x] Added support for special files (`AUTHORS` `CREDITS` `INSTALL` `COPYING`)

- [x] Significantly improved the documentation of the `README.md` file

- [x] Added support for issues and discussions, along with issue and discussion archival

- [x] Added support for the new Slim audio directory, a much smaller and more compact version set choice for the collection

- [x] Added support for graphics

- [x] Added several new songs that are public domain

- [x] Added the docs (documentation) directory

- [x] Added support for GitHub sponsors

- [x] Added lots of data to the truncated GitHub directory

- [x] Added the album art collection directory

- [x] Added the downloader script
