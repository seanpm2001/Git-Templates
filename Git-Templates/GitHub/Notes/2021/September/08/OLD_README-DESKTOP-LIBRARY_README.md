as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/README-Desktop-LIBrary/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# README_Desktop_LIBrary
A software library that natively renders README files in individual folders, just like GitHub, but on the Linux desktop. 

***

## About

See above. This project can apply a `README` preview to almost any portion of a program or directory. This was inspired by the functionality of `README.md` files on GitHub, and the idea was expanded upon so that `README` files could be placed anywhere and be customizable.

The use of capitalizing the first 3 letters of library (like so: LIBrary) was done to help people "learn through osmosis" and associate LIBRARY with the technical abbreviation of `LIB`

***
  
## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started on 2021, Wednesday, June 9th at 8:27 pm to expand on the idea of a `README` file being previewed in more than 1 place, and for `README.md` previews to make their way to the Linux desktop.

### Alpha history

This project laid abandoned for a long time. On 2021 June 24th, this project received its own organization.

On 2021 September 7th, plans were prepared for getting the project up to date, as it has laid on the backburner for a long time. The next day, on Wednesday 2021 September 8th, the project was updated to modernize its elements, add some basic configuration, and add support for the idea of `README` previews anywhere. It also received its own website.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
