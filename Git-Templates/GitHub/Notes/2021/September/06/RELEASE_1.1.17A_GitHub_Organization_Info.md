# Version 1.1.17A - 2021 September 6th

## V1.1.17A

### Changes:

This is the Seventy-third release of this project. It contains the basic data for 655 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 73rd release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V73 and not V74. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 1 day late night, as I ran out of time to last night.
