# GitHub organization: What-the-FLoC

## Description

A place for my DeGoogle article on Googles malicious FLoC system, what it is, and how to stop it.

## More info

[https://github.com/What-the-FLoC](https://github.com/What-the-FLoC/)

This organization is used for the archival and development of my DeGoogle article, what the FLoC. You can read it [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WHat-the-FLoC/)

## Extra info

I couldn't find any logos to criticize Google FLoC with, so I used the MS-Paint version of Google Chrome, as FLoC is Chrome-only, and I can use this joke once.

FLoC stands for "Federated Learning of Cohorts" which is a mass tracker system used in the Google Chrome web browser that shares your personal information with each site you visit as a way to "build your advertising profile" and """""make your ads more customized""""" (this is not the case, just look at Google Play Store ads and see the complaints, it is obvious that kids shouldn't be getting ads with nudity/teasing nudity/domestic violence/malware/foot surgery, or games about growing marijuana. Hell, just go to a Homescapes ad, or an ad for a pull the pin game (a discussion forum, NOT the actual ad) and look at the comments. You will realize this not the case) sorry for ranting here, to put it simply, Google does this tracking for selling your personal info. The real targetted ads are what Google hears through your Android/ChromeOS/Windows devices microphone. Those are always listening. FLoC will be worse than this.

FLoC is an attempt to replace cookies, but due to its various international law violations, it has brought anti-trust concerns in the US and Europe, and is being investigated as a serious violation of the GDPR in the European Union. It was universally condemned by every browser maker, except for Google (obviously) Currently, the only Chromium-based browser (or any browser at all) that supports FLoC is Google Chrome.

Yes, the article implies the usage of the 4 letter F word, I originally decided it was serious enough to do so. The name was also so original that it wasn't taken in several months. There are no problems with using swear words on GitHub unless you use it in a hateful or harmful way. I also try to limit my usage, as overusage of a swear word weakens its meaning. It also looks very childish if you use the F word in every sentence.

At the moment, I don't have the article developed to a showcase-able state, so it has not been forked here yet.

The above notes are from 2021 Thursday, September 16th.
