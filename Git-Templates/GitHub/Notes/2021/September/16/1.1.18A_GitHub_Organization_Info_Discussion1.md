# Version 1.1.18A - 2021 September 12th

## V1.1.18A

### Changes:

This is the Seventy-fifth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 656 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 75th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V75 and not V76. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This release is coming 4 days late, as I haven't had the time or will to work on this project for the past 4 days. This is the 2021 September 12th series of updates, but it is being released on 2021 September 16th
