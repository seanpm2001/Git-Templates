# DMR day release (2021 September 9th)

## 2021.09.09

### Changes

This is the first release of the SNU Memorial to Dennis Ritchie project and it is coming a bit late. Since this is the first release, all changes made are just what is in the repository so far. This version was released on 2021 September 9th as a late end of month update. This release is dedicated to Dennis Macalistair Ritchie (DMR) who would have been 80 years old today if he was still alive. He isn't a household name, but he was one of the best computer pioneers, creating the C programming language, and co-creating the UNIX operating system and its design philosophy.
