# My 2021 September Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of 2021 September.

2021 September would have been my 53rd consecutive month on Khan Academy if I didn't fail my streak earlier this year. This month, I continued the biology unit. I thought I finished it on 2021 September 29th, but noticed that there were still some chapters left, including a crash cource chapter, which I am excited for. Also 8 months ago, the consecutive day count meter was removed on January 4th 2021, which might make me stop using Khan Academy on 2021 December 31st (As I am in a self-made contract) I have been considering continued usage of the site, and I was pretty certain, until on 2021 April 20th, Khan Academy removed the ability to customize your background banner. The site is becoming too basic and similar to other crappy low-level sites, so I assume they are just going to keep getting rid of all good features, so I am now permanently confirming that I will no longer use Khan Academy on a daily or weekly basis starting January 1st 2022. I am considering reversing this, but it is a struggle now.

It spans from day 1554/1553 to day 1582/1581. 3 significant milestones were reached this month, they includes:

1. Day 1555

2. Day 1567

3. Day 1575

4. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

Are these really even consecutive anymore? y/**N**

There was a calculation error starting on September 5th where the days went from 1557 back to 1556, 1557, then continued normally with 2 days off. The error was noted, I didn't check into it until September 30th, when it was corrected.

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots nearly month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 16 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. ? months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. As of October 21st 2020, a new cellular image format is being used, where the image is vertical, instead of horizontal. This is done to more easily cover content, and make a solid difference between desktop and cellular images.

4. On November 12th 2020, I got a new phone (Switched from: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 256 GB) starting the next day, I began getting Khan Academy cellular screenshots on this device.

5. On January 4th 2021, Khan Academy removed the consecutive day count milestone and all badges related to it. Due to constant crappy design changes, I have decided to stop using Khan Academy on December 31st 2021, as that is when my current self-made trial ends. This would also help me DeGoogle, as Khan Academy uses YouTube, and then I can drop another instance of YouTube usage.

6. As of January 31st 2021, I have finalized the decision to quit Khan Academy sometime in early 2021

7. On February 13th 2021, I encountered a critical personal error, and was unable to do Khan Academy. THis would have been day 1356. The streak officially ended at 1355 days.

8. The day count continued normally from February 13th 2021 onward, but the number of days is 1 off. It is no longer a consecutive day count

9. I have been considering continued usage of the site, and I was pretty certain, until on April 20th 2021, Khan Academy removed the ability to customzie your background banner. The site is becoming too basic and similar to other crappy low-level sites, so I assume they are just going to keep getting rid of all good features, so I am now permanently confirming that I will no longer use Khan Academy on a daily or weekly basis starting January 1st 2022. This decision is still being considered

10. I have rolled back on the "permanent" decision and may continue using Khan Academy in 2022.

11. No other notes for this month
