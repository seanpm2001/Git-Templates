## SNU 0

SNU 0 was the very first iteration of SNU, and wasn't even considered SNU at the time (2017) it is unofficial.

***

## SNU 1

SNU 1.x was the first official iteration of SNU hosted on Google sites alongside my old website. It started in 2018.

***

## SNU 2

SNU 2.x was the second iteration of SNU, but was poorly built. It was mainly used as a draft. It contained many graphics, along with tons of non-functional script files.

The SNU Trends section was a section imported from SNU 1. It was used as a family video service, but it went unused. It has some questionable content on it (not anything sexual, just clickbait and other content) it is still far better than the YouTube trending tab.

***

## SNU 3

SNU 3.x is the current third iteration of  SNU, written from the ground up after inspiration sparked from linking 1 HTML file to another. This spurred me into web development from January 30th 2019 onward. I began to tutor myself heavily on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, SQL, WebVTT, XML, XHTML, SVG, ActionScript, and more.

It is still in development. Development has slowed down since May 25th 2020 due to the transition to GitHub.
