Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Computing-longevity/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Computing-longevity
The website for the Computational Longevity Standardization project.

***

## About

See above. This project is for Computing longevity and longevity standards. Its current goals are to:

- [ ] End planned obsolescence in both software and hardware

- [ ] Catalog various hardware and software and its compliance with these standards.

The main goal is for computers to last at minimum 50 years, and software to work until an eternity after the end of time.

***
  
## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was published on 2021 August 20th at 5:08 pm in compliance with a new goal of software and hardware longevity compliance. It received a little bit of development before being abandoned for 14 days. Its foundation was laid, and a website was created. I experienced my first GitHub pages build fail here with the `INSTALL` file, this was later fixed in the 2021 Saturday 4th update.

### Alpha history

I finally got to updating this project on 2021 Saturday 4th, mainly fixing the website, and getting it ready and up to date. I also fixed the error by temporarily deleting 2 files. Once I figure out how to add the file back without conflict, I will.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
