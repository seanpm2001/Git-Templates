## Legal

My health software is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3. There are some additional terms that need to be addressed:

* This software cannot be modified to be used in proprietary works - This software cannot be bundled with closed source/proprietary software, even if the closed source software has some open source components. This doesn't mean that the software can't be run on proprietary systems, such as Window 10 or MacOS. My medical works also cannot be sold for a profit (unless it is hardware) if you are selling my medical software for even a fraction of a penny, you are violating the license agreement and are scamming people.

* This software comes without a warranty - As much as I want to help people with their health, I can't guarantee that it will be 100% effective (although I aim for at least 95% effectiveness) Defective software situations should be reported. For safety, make sure to run a stable release that you trust. Don't always jump to the latest version, wait a bit first for testing to be done, so that it is safe for your patients.

* The use of the Switzerland flag was done to avoid being sued by the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, as they are aggressive when it comes towards use of their logo. Since their logo is just an inverted version of the flag of Switzerland, I used a detail image of the Swiss flag.

## Description

The GitHub organization for this project was shortened due to a character limit. Here is the full text.

# Organization description

My organization for health projects. I am committed to promoting open source, functional, and life saving medical software.

**The part that was cut off:**

Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (🇨🇭 Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of 🇨🇭 Switzerland, or 🇹🇷 Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.
