# V8 Template TODO

`template` branches

- [x] Create template branches

- [ ] Too much disclaimer, try to find out how to do a dropdown (without turning the entire page into a giant text box) or comment some of it out for now λ

- [ ] Mobile version: success, no improvements needed (other than maybe a way to ease navigation and tell where to scroll) λ

- [ ]  Repo directory, for description, tags, linked, and url (if none provided, use the "no description websites or URLs provided" that GitHub uses)

- [ ]  UTC-7 clarification

- [ ] Swisscows support

- [ ] Safe.duckduckgo support

- [ ] Removal of parantheses in title line

- [ ] Highly advanced .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore

- [ ] Google link (but it actually points to DeGoogle, don't be a jerk about it, just call it DeGoogle)

- [ ] Try to find a way to highlight more text or some other catchy way for important info, also clarify what is important λ

- [ ] Bold the text for the file info section headings, and file history section with bold, add support for MIME *.mkd and *.markdown

- [ ] HYBRID TEMPLATE: Mix of GitHub (pages) and Git (repository (normal))

- [ ] Separate branches for each template category, fit all your templates into one

- [ ] Update README files to specifically fit each branch

- [ ] Fix typos

- - [ ] I have done the following steps for all branches

`main` branch

- [ ] Make the branch list in the `!USING_THIS_TEMPLATE` instruction file into a functional link lisrt.

- [ ]  Archive all 11 branches into the main branch

- [ ]  Archive all 11 pull requests

- [ ] Update README

- [ ] Finish TODO list

- [ ] Turn repository into template (once all other steps are done)
