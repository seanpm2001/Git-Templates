# Using this template

Starting with version 8 of my series of templates, all the templates have been combined into one via Git branches.

# WARNING

Before you complete forking this project, please make sure you have followed the following instructions, or this template will be of no use to you.

_The DeGoogle V2 template was used as a reference, as I haven't transformed the V8 template into a template yet at the time of writing this, and I needed a quick reference._

Click on the [use this template] button (don't fork the project)

Check the box (this will fork all the branches required to use this set of templates.

## How to use this template

Once you have completed the template process listed above, you will have a fresh new repository with all the templates. The default branch is `main` but it is of no use for the template process.

There are currently 11 other branches. You can delete all the branches you don't want to use and set your preferred one as the default branch, or you can just switch the default branch to your preference.

Here is a guide to the 11 template branches:

`Template-SPM2001-Journaling` - This is my personal default journaling template for the Seanpm2001 life archive project

`Template-SPM2001-Map` - This is my personal map data journaling template for the Seanpm2001 life archive project

`Template-Snapcraft` - This is the snapcraft template for creating snap packages.

`Template-SNU-Programming-Tools` - This is the SNU Programming Tools template for SNU projects related to the IDE collection set.

`Template-SNU-Other` - This is a miscellaneous SNU template for other SNU projects.

`Template-SNU-Default` - This is the default SNU template for general SNU projects.

`Template-Meadows` - This is the template for the Meadows operating system project for its subprojects.

`Template-GitHub-Pages-language` - This is my GitHub pages template for language category organizations.

`Template-GitHub-Pages-default` - This is my GitHub pages template for general projects.

`Template-DeGoogle` - This is my template for my DeGoogle article project series.

`Template-Other` - This is my template for my other projects that don't fall under the other categories.
