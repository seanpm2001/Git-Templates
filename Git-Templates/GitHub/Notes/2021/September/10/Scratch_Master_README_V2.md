Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Scratch/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# Seanpm2001-Scratch
A collection of all my scratch projects from [https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) and my other accounts. Many projects can't be uploaded yet due to the GitHub 25 Megabyte limit.

[View the archive here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scratch_Master/)

***

## About

See above. This project is an archive of my Scratch projects from 2018 to ~2020 when I still used Scratch. Scratch was a major building block(s) for getting me into computer science. I moved on to functional programming and markup documentation work in 2018, and slowly abandoned Scratch over time, although up until around 2020, I still used Scratch as a graphic design tool, and a tool to make demos for concepts.

## Clarifications

* On Scratch, I commonly attributed the acronym `Masters In Technology` to MIT, when the actual acronym is `Massachusetts Institute of Technology`

* Projects began getting exported under Scratch 3. I did not create any projects on the Scratch website during the 3.0 era, and I highly dislike the changes made

* Scratch is a block based programming language, but is not a functional programming language like C, C++, Python, Java, or the like. Scratch is still a good language to use for projects like basic demos, graphic design, community, simple programming, and beginner robotics. Once you reach its limits, you should consider moving on

* As of the time I tried to archive the data here, many projects were regarded as secret and weren't uploaded. The other reason why not all projects are currently present is because GitHub has a 25 megabyte upload limit, and many of my Scratch projects went above that (although they stopped at 50 megabytes, as that is Scratchs project size limit)

* A lot of my older projects were childish, as, well I was a child while developing them.

## Accounts

I had several Scratch accounts, but I mostly used these 2:

[Seanspokane2015](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015/) - My original Scratch account, created in 2015 February. This is my main account.

[seanwallawalla](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanwallawalla/) - This was an alternative account that was still used. I tried to make it the main account, but never came close

[Gruffpatch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/gruffpatch/) - A parody account of Scratchs top user Griffpatch. This account wasn't really used that much. It doesn't contain any original projects

[Other](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scratch_Master/issues/) - Please raise an issue if you want to see the other accounts.

## Studios

Along with backing up my entire Scratch account, I am still trying to figure out how to backup studios. I tried some methods, but they were cumbersome and ineffective.

## Genres

My projects ranged across several genres, including fake operating systems, graphic design software, video games, articles, books, memes, and more.

There are a lot of Five Nights At Freddys projects, I had some obsession with it, and they came far in development, but were still not very good.

## Style of programming

My programming style on Scratch is undetermined. [examine a project and tell me what you think the style is](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Scratch_Master/issues/)

***

## Career

I had a moderate career on Scratch before moving on to Python, then web development, then multi-stack development. These projects are historic and are used for archival and legacy purposes, and to show how far I have come.

## Moving on

I have moved on from Scratch.

## Scratch for Linux

Scratch 3 is currently unavailable for Linux, but you can run it through a Windows/MacOS virtual machine, use WINE, use the website, or find another website to view and make projects.

## History

This project has a long history

### Pre-history

I started Scratch in February 2015 after I got moved from the wrong class (some sewing class) to my first computer science class, which transformed me into the programmer I am today. I used Scratch from 2015 to about 2020.

In 2019, I worked on a long project in Python where I indexed and archived Scratch projects for over a month. I missed some projects, and the archive is incomplete, as Scratch 3 corrupted a few projects. The index remained dormant, until I moved the project to GitHub on 2020 June 5th at 2:39 pm.

### Alpha history

This project began development on 2020 June 5th. It received lots of content and catching up, but didn't match the full archive due to some issues.

On May 26th 2021, this project received its own organization. On June 2nd 2021, it received its own programming language category organization.

On 2021 August 13th, this project was partially brought up to date, and some basic work began on it, but stalled again until 2021 September 10th.

On 2021 September 10th, this project was modernized further, and documented better. It also received its own website.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

No Modern history to show for this project.

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
