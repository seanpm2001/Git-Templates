Notes to add to project language file:

@* - The languages associated with SNU programming tools are not included as project language files, as there are too many to list.
@1 - HTML is a core language of the web, and the first computer language I learned
@2 - CSS is a core language of the web, and was the second language I supplemented SNU with
@3 - JS is a core language of the web, and was the third language I supplemented SNU with officially.
@4 - PHP is a web language that I experimented with when developing SNU, and it is one of the used languages of the platform.
@5 - Ruby is a web language that I experimented with when developing SNU but didn't make much progress with. Nonetheless, it is one of the languages used on the platform.
@6 - Java is a programming language that I was learning whilst developing SNU early on. I was horrible with programming, and wrote completely non-functional code under the Java name, mostly pseudocode and planning, that isn't compatible with Java or JavaScript
@7 - Python is a programming language that I use on the backend of SNU due to my knowledge of the language and its performance
@8 - Less is a stylesheet language I began experimenting with as a possible alternative to CSS. It will not replace CSS in SNU
@9 - WebAssembly is a high level instruction language that is used carefully on some parts of SNU for hardware emulation
