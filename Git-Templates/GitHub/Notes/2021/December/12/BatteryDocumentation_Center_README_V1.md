# Battery documentation

## Welcome to my battery documentation center!

I have a strong focus on batteries, battery life, their performance, and their activity. This directory houses data regarding my experience with battery performance across 4 families of operating systems. The knowledge here is out for public use, and is actively worked on, although help is needed.

These articles are written using LibreOffice. The ODT document is the source document, but I export it into 3 other formats (Plain text (*.txt) Portable Document Format (*.pdf) and Electronic Publication (*.epub)) as of 2021 December 12th, the PDF and Plain Text versions are the only ones that can be viewed directly through GitHub. I don't have plans to support the *.doc or *.docx formats, most office software (except for Apple Pages) can handle the ODT format just fine.
