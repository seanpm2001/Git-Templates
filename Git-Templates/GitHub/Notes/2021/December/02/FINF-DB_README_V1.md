Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/FINF-dev/FINF-DB/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# FINF-DB
The database for the FINF (File INFo) project, a FLOSS collaborative file format, shebang, file system, and file type information project.

***

## About

See above. FINF is a collaborative file extension database that aims to document every file extension through massive community collaboration. It also plans to document every special file type (such as `README` or `CREDITS`, which don't have a file extension, but are recognizable) every file system, and every Shebang (such as `#!bin/sh`)

This project relies on collaboration to survive. A lot needs to be worked on. If you want to make a contribution (even if it is something as simple as adding a missing `.`) feel free to help. Before you send a pull request, please go through the documentation center:

[Click/tap here to visit the documentation center](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FINF-DB/tree/main/FINF/Documentation/)

FINF is written in HTML (majority) along with Pug, Handlebars, Mustache, XML, CSS, and Less, and sample files are in almost all programming languages.

## Wiki

If the project has been forked, the Wiki was likely removed. Luckily, I include an embedded version. You can view it [here](/External/ProjectWiki/).

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was conceived on 2021 Saturday, November 27th during an attempt to learn the Pug programming language. I had been considering making my own file info service, and when I came up with the Portmanteau `FINF` (File Info) I began developing the concept. I designed a very verbose file system for the project, and began work the next day on 2021 Sunday, November 28th at 4:08 pm.

### Alpha history

Development started on 2021 November 28th. I began updating the project on a daily basis, adding support for new file formats, shebangs, special files, file systems, and documentation. As of 2021 December 2nd, documentation is available only in English and Esperanto. I can't add too many files per day, and as of 2021 December 2nd, I am still adding things as I go, and do not have a set system yet. I have been making lots of errors, and await a collaborator to come and help, because I can't document hundreds of thousands of file extensions by myself.

On 2021 Thursday December 2nd, this project was again updated. Its `README.md` file was improved, and the project received its own GitHub Pages website, but did not receive a snapcraft package, as it currently doesn't need to be distributed there.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
