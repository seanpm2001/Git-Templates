# Version 1.1.39B - 2021 December 7th

## V1.1.39B

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-sixteenth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 750 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 116th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V116 and not V117. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

The current batch today is part of 3 or more batches for the first half of December. Depending on how much time I have this week, it will either be finished by Wednesday, or Thursday.

See below for more changes.
