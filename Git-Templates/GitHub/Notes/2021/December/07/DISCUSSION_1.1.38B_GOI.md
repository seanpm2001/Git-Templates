# Version 1.1.38B - 2021 December 6th

## V1.1.38B

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-fourteenth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 740 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 114th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V114 and not V115. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

The current batch today is part of 3 or more batches for the first half of December. Depending on how much time I have this week, it will either be finished by Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.

See below for more changes.
