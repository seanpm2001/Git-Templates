<userNotes>
I recently started using the Kindle again to read a book about TMS therapy and I realized how much there was to the Kindle and how much I have been missing.
The Kindle hasn't been updated since 2015, it is a very old device.
Unfortunately, at the moment, it seems like this operating system is really difficult/nearly impossible to get a disk image of to virtualize, similar to iOS/iPhoneOS/iPadOS
The apps on here date from before 2016, so please know that the selected apps may no longer be relevant to you
