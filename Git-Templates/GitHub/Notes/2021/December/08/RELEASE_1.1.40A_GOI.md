# Version 1.1.40A - 2021 December 8th

## V1.1.40A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-seventeenth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 760 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 117th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V117 and not V117. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

The current batch today is part of 3 or more batches for the first half of December. The project has been extended by at least 2 days, and I cannot give an accurate estimate now. The closest I can be done is Friday if nothing is added, but work may be held off for next week.

See below for more changes.
