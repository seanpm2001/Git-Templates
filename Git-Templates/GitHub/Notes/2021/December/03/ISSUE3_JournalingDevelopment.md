### [TODO] add README files for January 2001 to August 2016

I want this project to have a full index of every day of data, regardless if the data exists or not.

I did not start journaling on a daily basis until 2016 September. Entries from 2001 January to 2016 August will need to have README files added in.

Chore difficulty level: 0.1/10.0 (as easy as it gets)
