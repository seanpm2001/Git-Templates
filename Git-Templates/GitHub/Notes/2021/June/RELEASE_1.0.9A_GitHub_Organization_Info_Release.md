Version 1.0.9A - June 17th 2021 #23

<!-- TODO TODAY

Organization info for 501 to 502 and onward will be placed in the `1.1` directory, instead of the `1` directory. If you fail on this goal, just download the repository, delete the 2 organization info directories, and re-upload them to the `1.1` directory
