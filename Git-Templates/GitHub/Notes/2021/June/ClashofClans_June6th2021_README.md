# Clash of Clans session June 6th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 7 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 6 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 3 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it)

## Main village

I did some upgrades in my main village, upgrading my 2nd air defense to level 7, and upgrading several walls to level 10. I didn't get raided, so I got to keep all my revenue. I want to focus on air defense from now on, until it gets too expensive, as my ground defense is doing very well, but my air defense is failing, which is why most of my attacks against me using air troops get 100% of my village. It may be too expensive, after the upgrades to the air defense buildings, and the 1 remaining wizard tower, it may be too expensive to maintain, so I will go back to getting cannons to level 12.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I did well and was able to upgrade a wall segment, along with an upgrade to my mega tesla to level 3. 6 levels to go after this, then I will be closer to a 2nd builder.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today. It is extremely effective for the range of 2600-3000 trophies.

## Overview

See above.
