# How to escape the wrath of my frogs

## Fly guide

If you are a fly in the ponds of my frog pocket dimension, here are some tips for survival.

## Don't

There is no guaranteed way to survive. Survival is at random. This advice doesn't work in all situations.

## Fly out of the way

Sometimes, you may be able to fly out of the way, but not if I am in a frenzy with my frogs.

## Don't group with other flies

Don't group together with other flies, you are just starting a frenzy.

## Try to stay away from my path

Try to stay away from the current path of the frogs.

## Note

I am not crazy, I know the flies in this game can't understand anything and are programmed to do the task of flying in random directions. This document is mainly a joke done out of interest in the game.
