# Tiny Death Star session June 4th 2021

I had a shorter session today, doing many elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I did not construct any new floors today. I made mixed progress.

## Overview
