# TouchPetsDogs2Rewritten
A recreation of the old iOS game "Touch Pets Dogs 2" by ngmoco. The game has been shut down for over 6 years, and I have really missed it.

About

Why the recreation?
-----------

It was a game from my early childhood, and I really miss it. It no longer exists, as the servers went down almost a whole decade ago. ngmoco isn't even an active company anymore
