# Bit City session June 1st 2021

I had a medium length Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before a medical appointment. I reached a city population of 758,000 today.

## Upgrades

I didn't do any upgrades today.

### Common upgrades

I didn't do any common upgrades today, as none were available.

### Epic upgrades

I didn't buy any epic upgrades today.

## Building

I constructed dozens of buildings today, and made a lot of progress here. I am up to a population of 512000 now (512000 - 511488 = 512 (16 * 32 = 512)) a unique number in mathematics and computing.

## Cars

I did not buy any new cars today.

## Boats

I bought the 5th boat type again. It hasn't paid off yet.

## Double time

I used the double time boost at least 2 times today to make gameplay a bit faster, and didn't go without it today.

## Play duration

I played for over 25 minutes today.

## Overview

See above.
