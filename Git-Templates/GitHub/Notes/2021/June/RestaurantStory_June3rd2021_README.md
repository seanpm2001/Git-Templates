# Restaurant Story session June 3rd 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I decided to make omeletes today instead of bacon and eggs to mix things up, and so I could have less interaction with the game, and also have more time to prepare for today. I ended up making both.

The game did not crash today. Not much was done, I was trying to brush past the gameplay again today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
