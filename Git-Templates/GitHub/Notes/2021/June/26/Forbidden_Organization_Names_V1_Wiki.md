## Forbidden organization names

While toying with GitHub organizations before attempting to create the next one on my list, sometimes I tinkered with random names and found what is allowed and what isn't. Surprisingly, racial slurs and swear words are not restricted, but of course they have already been taken.

This list will go through the organizations names that are restricted.

Note: restrictions apply to the terms in all caps, lower case, and MiXeD CaSe.

### Restricted

`C`

`D`

`W`

`README`

**More entries coming soon**

### Not restricted

Surprisingly, these terms are not restricted, but they have already been taken:

`Microsoft`

`Git`

`GitHub`

I will not list swear words or slurs, as they have no place here.
