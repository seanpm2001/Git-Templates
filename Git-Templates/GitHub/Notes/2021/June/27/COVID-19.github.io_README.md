## About

See above. This repository is for a joke program that aims to provide humor and raise awareness of COVID-19 solutions, and a reminder to stay safe.

## Humor

Check out my code distancing project

About: Code distancing is my most developed joke program that aims to bring social distancing into programming by making all lines of code 6 line breaks apart.

It is highly advanced, and currently covers nearly 100 different programming languages, comes with documentation, a story, plot hole fills, a discussion room for every language used, and a tool to code distance code automatically. It also raises awareness and gives advice regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Advice

* This pandemic can be solved by being careful and trusting the science. At this point (June 28th 2021) there is no reason to not get vaccinated, and any death of COVID-19 past this point due to refusing to get a vaccine is entirely preventable.

* Wear a mask, even when outside (if you want to be extra careful)

* Your mask will help you if you are introverted. It is still important regardless, but it is a gift for introverted people to be able to hide so much of their face and not be considered weird or crazy.

* Vaccine hesitancy is a real problem. Make sure you read from the right sources and don't get caught up in misinformation.

* Don't throw away your mask, even after the pandemic is over. You may need it again in the future. You can also have it as a souveneir, saying you were careful and surived the SARs V2 COVID-19 pandemic.

* Vaccines are safe, don't be hesitant.

* Vaccines do not hurt that much. Personal advice from me: don't look at the needle while they are doing it, stop looking 3 seconds before, and due to how careful these vaccine givers usually are, you likely will feel a very tiny sting, far less painful than getting stung by any type of bee. I would rate the pain 0.004/10.00 (it only hurts for a maximum of 3 seconds as well)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## Code hospital

Starting with an update on February 28th 2021, I began making improvements to this project again. I categorized parts of it to have a running joke, where each programming language is in its own separate room at a code hospital. Inside each room, program scripts are showcasing how to code distance. New features that started being added today include support for image versions (if you want to see what it looks like in different environment) and a README file showcasing support info, some more jokes, and a link to a discussion where you can support the programming languages you like.

To get into the code hospital, you have to put on a mask first. You can go in without a mask, and infect everyone (this project currently isn't interactive, so you should just use your imagination for this)

Heavy disclaimer (unfortunately I actually need one of these, as some people might actually believe this project isn't fiction)

**Disclaimer: the code hospital and codevid-19 are joke concepts for this project and are not real. Computer programs cannot get infected with medical diseases, this theme is meant to be a joke that helps raise awareness for the bad times we are in.**
