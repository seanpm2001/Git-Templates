# File system

This is the built-in file system for TuxBot. You can choose any modern file system, and any Linux distribution to use with TuxBot.

For copyright and size reasons, disk images are not included by default. You can download them here:

Ubuntu: [https://ubuntu.com/download](https://ubuntu.com/download) Old.Ubuntu: [http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/]

Fedora: [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/install-guide/Downloading_Fedora/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/install-guide/Downloading_Fedora/)

For Fedora 7 and up: [https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/](https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/)

For Fedora Core 1 to Core 6: [https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/](https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/)

Other Linux downloads currently not being linked to. You can go find them on your own, as there are too many for me to list.

If you are missing files in the directories, you can reinstall TuxBot OS. If you aren't missing too many, copy the following script and place it in the empty directories:

# Please place a disk image in this directory

This directory is for holding Linux distribution boot images/Live CDs. If one is not already here, please place one if you have it.

Due to copyright and size reasons, disk images do not come with the Tux Bot operating system. You will need to supply them yourself.
