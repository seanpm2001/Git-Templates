### File structure error - /ProjectWiki/ not included in //External/

There is a minor file structure error in this project that makes the structure inconsistent with other projects. This being the `/ProjectWiki/` directory is outside of the `//External/` directory. This is a very easy fix, all that needs to be done is for the Wiki to be re-uploaded. The original files will be kept for now. I will fix this issue soon.

That is interesting. I can close issues just by mentioning them in a commit.
