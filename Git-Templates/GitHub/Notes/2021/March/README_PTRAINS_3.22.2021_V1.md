# WARNING

During my session, I came across an incredibly disgusting and disturbing ad targeted towards children. I have a high tolerance for ads when gaming, but this was just too far. I have been using these screenshots as a way of having evidence against bad ad development for when advertisers attempt to hide these in the future and get a fresh start.

In the 1500 folder, try to avoid the following files:

## Gameplay March 22nd 2021

I had a very long and relaxing today, but overplayed. I made tons of bux, got closer to level 12, and made many trips to Europe, Africa, North America, and Asia, but also made some visits to South America (I haven't reached Oceania or Australia yet)
