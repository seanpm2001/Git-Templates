# Documentation

( [Read this article in Esperanto](/FINF/Documentation/README/Esperanto/README.md) | **Read this article in English (selected)** )

This is the documentation center for the FINF project. It is for development reference. If you are looking for file extension, file, shebang, and file system documentation, you are in the wrong place. The link to file extension documentation is [/FINF/Database/DB/](/FINF/Database/DB/)

## Languages

Currently, documentation is only being done in 2 languages: English and Esperanto. This is done because I don't have the time to translate into any more languages. English is my native language, and Esperanto is a Lingua Franca (Latin: bridge language) There is also the problem of inaccuracy, as Google Translate was used for translation (it is the only translator I have, unfortunately Bing translate and DeepL don't meet my needs, so I am still stuck with Google Translate)

## Wiki

Documentation is also available in the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FINF-DB/wiki/) however, as of 2021 Sunday November 28th, I haven't added it there yet.
