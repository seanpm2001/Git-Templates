# Collaboration

_Read this article in a different language:_

[Language list unavailable](/FINF/Documentation/Collaboration/)

This project relies heavily on collaboration. I specifically designed this program, so that collaboration would be easy. It would be impossible for one person to manually document every file extension, file system, shebang, and file format. This document will go over the collaboration process for this project.

## Page style

Follow the style of the default pages made by [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) this includes the following pages:

These files are located under `/FINF/Database/DB` you will need to manually find the files.

```txt
.txt
.TXT
.cyc
.go
NTFS
#!/bin/sh 
CREDITS
```

Follow and mix the styles of these pages (Do not mix the style of a file extension type with a file type, a file system type, a shebang type, and vice versa) If you have an idea for an improvement, [raise an issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FINF-DB/issues/)

I need to make a better style guide. This is as good as I can get right now.

## Maintenance

This project needs maintainers to make sure info stays up to date, and is relevant.
