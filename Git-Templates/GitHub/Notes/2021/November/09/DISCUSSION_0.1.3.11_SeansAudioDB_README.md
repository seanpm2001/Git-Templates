# Version 0.1.3.11 - 2021 Tuesday November 9th update

## V0.1.3.11

### About

This is the first update I am making to the audio collection today on GitHub. This release archives the progress from 2021 November 9th. I didn't produce an update yesterday, as I didn't add any new playlist additions due to skipping audio conversion.

This update changes some things, including:
