### Learning Rust

I started learning the Rust programming language before using GitHub, but increased its usage afterwards. I have found it to be a fast and stable language.

In 2021 on GitHub, I participated in Ruffle-RS and did basic code reviews, and learnt the language slightly better via communication on issues.

I don't know too much about the language, this document will go over all my knowledge of the Rust programming language so far.

#### Comments in Rust

Comments in Rust are similar to that of C, C++, C#, CSS.

```rust
// This is a single line comment
/* This 
is a multi-
line com-
ment */
```

#### Hello World in Rust

Rust's print statement uses an exclamation point. It is slightly strange to me.

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}
```

#### Break keyword in Rust

```rust
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Booleans in Rust

Rust supports Booleans. This example includes content that will be mentioned in further entries. This example is not the best, I came up with it on the fly.

```rust
// Checking if a value is greater or less than 0
let valueT: bool = true;
let valueF: bool = false;
int x = -33
if (x > 0) {
	return valueT();
} else {
	return valueF();
}
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Integers in Rust

Rust supports integers, as like almost all programming languages.

```rust
let x: int = 2;
return x();
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### If and else statements in Rust

Rust supports if and else statements, as like almost all modern programming languages.

```rust
let x: int = 1;
if (x > 0) {
	println!("You entered a value at or below 0");
} else {
	println!("You entered a value at or above 0");
}
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of the Rust programming language

1. Rust is a semicolon and curly bracket language

2. Rust uses the `.rs` file extension.

3. Rust is used in many major projects, notably including the Firefox web browser, Ruffle-RS, and more.

4. Rust developers are known as `rustaceans` similar to how Python developers are known as `pythoneers` or `pythonistas`

5. Rust is a highly stable language

6. No other known knowledge of the Rust programming language at the moment
