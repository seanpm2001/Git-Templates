### Learning Google Golang (programming language)

**Not to be confused with the [Go! programming language](#Learning-Go!-(programming-language)) by Francis McCabe**

I don't know very much about the Google Go programming language, and it is a language I intend to not learn much about. This document will go over my knowledge of the Go programming language.

#### Hello World in Google Go

This is an example of a hello world program in the Google Go programming language.

```go
package main

import "fmt" // Import Formatting settings

func main()
{ // This is the way I associate curly bracket usage in Go, as I see examples written like this, with the curly bracket wasting an extra line
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

#### Comments in Google Go

Comments in Go are identical to comments in C, JavaScript, CSS, C#, C++, etc..

```go
// This is a single line comment
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
/* This is 
* also a
* Multi-line
* comment */
```

#### Break keyword in Google Go

```go
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of the Google Go programming language

1. Go was created in 2009 by Google

2. Google steamrolled over the Go! programming language

3. Google Go is created by Google

4. Go is a semicolon and curly bracket language

5. Go is meant to be a minimal recreation of the C programming language 

6. Google Go uses the `.go` file extension

7. Google uses a **Go**pher as a mascot for the **Go** programming language.

8. No other knowledge of the Google go programming language
