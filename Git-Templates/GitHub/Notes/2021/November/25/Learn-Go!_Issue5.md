### [Education] Need further knowledge

I am having difficulty finding documentation on the Go! programming language online, as it is eclipsed by Googles Go language, the language they said wouldn't get steamrolled by them.

I want to be able to include some examples, and fix the project language file issue in #4 

I need help finding the following knowledge:

* Creating a Hello World program

* Making source code comments

* Seeing if the `break` keyword is supported

* Anything else that is part of the basics
