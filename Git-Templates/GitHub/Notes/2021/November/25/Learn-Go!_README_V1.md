### Learning Go! (programming language)

**Not to be confused with [Google Golang (2009)](#Learning-Google-Golang-(programming-language))**

I don't know too much about the Go! programming language, but I know it was unfairly steamrolled by Google, and that it is an agent based programming language, among other things.

I can't find documentation on how to do anything in this language. No programming examples are currently available.

#### Other knowledge of the Go! programming language

1. Go! was created in 2004 by Francis McCabe

2. Google steamrolled over the Go! programming language in 2009 with its Go language

3. Go! is an Agent based programming language

4. Go! still isn't officially recognized by sites like GitHub (as of 2021 November 24th)

5. Go! uses the `.go` file extension

6. Go! is a semi-colon and curly bracket language

7. No other knowledge of the Go! programming language
