# Version 1.1.34B - 2021 November 21st

## V1.1.34B

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-sixth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 710 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 106th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V106 and not V107. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

A template message was accidentally kept in to the last release, I did not fall behind on time yesterday, as I wasn't working on this project yesterday in a way that would require a release (documenting at least 1 organization)

See below for more changes.
