## Context

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

I discovered on 2021 November 7th that the `.github` repository is an override project. I have been struggling to maintain so many different projects and their settings, and I have found that this method is something I needed for a long time.

There were a few discoveries that led up to it. The first one was finding that the `.github` repo on an organization added a code of conduct to every project. For a couple weeks, I was confused why certain forks were giving out a code of conduct, and I didn't rule it down to `/seanwallawalla-forks/.github` for a while. Once I figured it out, I still didn't piece together that it was an override project.

When visiting the IBM organization, I learned that a GitHub organization can contain a `README.md` file, similar to how the `<username>/<username>` creates a `README.md` on your profile page. For the `.github` repo, it has to be placed under `/profile/README.md` instead of just `/README.md`

I didn't create the repository until November 7th, and I didn't start forking it to other organizations until November 16th. Initially, it was only going to be a test, but I forked it to 70 organizations the same day. For `seanwallawalla-forks` I had to rename a fork, something I have not done on purpose before, so that the correct `.github` repository would display.

I intend to keep the description short, but it was hard, as I had to leave out a lot. I also can't maintain each individual iteration of the project.

## FAQ

<details><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section</p></summary>

### Why are there so many forks?

I fork projects here as a way to mirror them easily. Cloning is not the best practice, and forking them puts them up in their latest state. I still need a way to automate fork updates.

Some projects are forked here because they are related to the subject. For example in language organizations, any project of mine that contains Python source code will be forked to the Python language collection, [@seanpm2001-python](https://github.com/seanpm2001-Python/)

### Why do you have so many organizations?

I manage over a thousand projects, and I feel that organizations are a good way to display their content, and to give them a home. I have organizations for every language I use, every project I have, and also most sub-projects.
