# Articles to write (SeansAudioDB Wiki)

<!-- TODO ![]() What should the image be? !-->

I have recently noted the importance of the project Wiki in 2021 September, and worked heavily on the Wiki for the [WacOS project](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS/wiki/) and I plan to do the same here, just with a different subject.

<!-- This project has become a strong Apple Wiki, and it expands outside the scope of just WacOS. Articles should still be based on WacOS when possible, but also contain info on Apple - 2021 Saturday September 18th !-->

**Articles to write:** `194` _(this number will continue to go up over time, as more topics are found during research)_

**Articles written so far:** `20` / `194` (10.31%) _Note: the homepage, footer, and sidebar are also included in this count._

**Stats are as of 2021, Tuesday, November 16th at 8:17 pm**

<!-- TODO Notes TODO

<!-- Notes
I usually label the ownership rights to the creator and not the record company. The creator made it, they deserve the credit.

If the song is over 70 years old, I label it public domain.

It would be nice to have a copyleft option

Sections VLC won't let me fill out: Now playing, encoded by

Playlist complications with multi-line descriptions on the first playlist entry

Song titles are now named with an underscore separating the artist from the song name

**Total entries:** `194` **Completed:** `20` _(as the footer, homepage, and sidebar are counted)_

**Current completion status (as of 2021 Tuesday, November 16th at 8:17 pm):** `10.31%`

<details>
	<summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the total percentage estimate mathematical formula</p></summary>

**Percent complete calculation formula:** `completed` `y` `/` `total` `x` _=_ `answer`, **or** `y` `/` `x`

( `completed` == `y` | `total` == `x` | `answer` == `sum` )

**Important notes:**

`don't let the decimal confuse you`

`don't divide x by y, instead divide y by x`

`if your calculator puts zeroes before the decimal, that is a normal calculator. Pretend that the number 10-99 comes after the 0, and once it passes 99.99, it goes to 100.00` (I don't know how to explain this better)

</details>

**Other notes (not related to the formula)**

_I just keep adding to this list, as I keep finding new entries. It seems for every 1-5 entries I complete, 10-30 get added to the todo list._

## How to make your own checklist in Markdown

<details>
	<summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the section that tells you how to make your own Markdown checklist</p></summary>

```markdown
- [ ]
```

is equal to:

- [ ]

```markdown
- [x]
```

is equal to:

- [x]

```markdown
- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar
```

is equal to:

- [ ] Foo

- [x] Bar

Alternatively, this works:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo
- [x] Bar
```

Note the lack of a blank line between each box. I choose to add the blank line, as some of my markdown viewers (including the one on GitHub in some spots) have problems if I don't separate things with spaces, and will format like this:

```markdown
- [ ] Foo-[x] Bar
```
