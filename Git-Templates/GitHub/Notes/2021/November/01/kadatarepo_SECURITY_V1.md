# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

This project is still in its early stages, although the only functional part is essentially a set of basic web and database query programs. They were tested via Khan Academy, and likely don't have much issue.

For general security vulnerabilities, use the `security` label and start your issue title with `[SECURITY]`. Remember to not publicly post critical/zero day vulnerabilities, see more on this below.

If somehow my Khan Academy account info is cracked, be a good Samaritan and not post the information publicly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

DO NOT REPORT A ZERO DAY VULNERABILITY PUBLICLY!

Please instead direct message me via GitHub. If there is no response within 90 days, you can post the vulnerability as an issue, as part of the standard 0 day security exploit reporting guidelines.

If a vulnerability is caused by an outdated dependancy, you can report it publicly, as it usually isn't that much of a problem.

If account vulnerability is found, please do not disclose the information publicly.

</details>

# Dependencies

<details open><summary><p>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</p></summary>

Dependency problems aren't very bad. This project uses 5 different languages:

- [x] HTML5

- [x] CSS3

- [x] JavaScript 1.8

- [x] SQL

You can still report dependency problems, but dependencies usually won't be updated unless they get too old (5+ years before the most recent release) or they aren't common enough to download anymore. The current dependencies this project has include:

- [x] CSS 3.0 (although the program will still run with any version of CSS prior to CSS 2.0 as of 2021 October 28th at 8:00 pm)

- [x] JavaScript 1.8 (bumping the version up or down a little bit shouldn't be harmful, just test it first.)

- [x] SQL ? (unknown SQL version)
