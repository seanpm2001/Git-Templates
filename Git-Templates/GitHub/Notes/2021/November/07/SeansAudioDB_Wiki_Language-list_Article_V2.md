# Language list

My music and sound effect collection features audio in the following languages:

**This list is sorted A-Z**

**Language count:** `22/23`

* Arabic

* Any (for ambient/no vocal audio) (most common)

* Bulgarian

* Chinese

* Danish

* English (2nd most common)

* Finnish

* French

* German

* Icelandic

* Japanese

* Korean (North) (rarest, only used in 1 song)

* Korean (South)

* Mongolian (modern, Cyrillic)

* Persian

* Polish

* Punjabi

* Romanian

* Russian

* Serbian

* Spanish

* Swedish

* Turkish

Note: the origin country of the composer is not counted in this count, as it wouldn't make sense. So Bach music isn't counted as German, even though the origin was Germany/a German composer, it is counted as "any" as it is ambient/instrumental music.
