## MEDOS commercial

The MEDOS commercial was an old project within this project for a commercial for the product.

The commercial uses audio files of Stephen Hawking [generated by Lingojam](https://lingojam.com/StephenHawkingVoiceGenerator) and talks about the future of [dos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) over old operating systems and [286 computers (NON HTTPS LINK WARNING)](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/userdata/images/large/56/32/product-75632.jpg). The commercial is outdated.
