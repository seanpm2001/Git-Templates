# Milestone 5 version 1.0A - 2021 Friday November 5th

## M5V1.0A

### About

This is the first of the final releases for this project. I have stopped playing Virtual City Playground today. I planned for it to be a temporary thing anyways. The game wouldn't load on the first 2 attempts today, and I decided it wasn't worth it to keep trying. I have already made all the progress I wanted to make, getting back up to where I was in 2015, and then some. Progress has been getting slower and slower, and it just isn't fun anymore. So this is goodbye. I want to try to have more daily games from now on, as this was pretty fun.

This release archives my progress from 2021 October 17th to 2021 November 5th. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Started the project

- [x] Added images and status entries for my sessions from 2021 October 17th to 2021 November 5th

- [x] Added the standard repository files

- [ ] No other changes in this release
