## VLC documentation

This Wiki documents VLC Media Player alongside my audio collection. This Wiki covers the audio end of VLC documentation. For VLC video documentation, try the [Video wiki](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_VideoDirectory/wiki/).

I am working on creating a good documentation draft for VLC, as I am volunteering to help them with documentation, since they don't have enough documentation writers. I don't have a good enough draft ready yet.
