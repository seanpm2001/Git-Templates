## Benefits of TrueCalm over Calm

### The 6 major improvements

1. No trackers (You don't need every little aspect of your life being tracked, trackers only worry you more, and don't help you calm down. Don't let trackers take advantage of you when you are in a mentally submissive state)

2. Fully open source (no proprietary software, look inside and see everything is done, no tricks, no hiding anything from you. Don't like something? Change it. Want something new? Change it.)

3. Registration not required to use any part of the program (Calm requires you to create an account before you can even start, even if you choose to have no preferences)

4. No Internet connection required to use (Calm likely requires an Internet connection to use, since an online account is tied to everything. This is something that shouldn't require an Internet connection)

5. Smaller download sizes (with lite options available, and heavy options if preferred)

6. Better/no advertising for the software (Without the contradictional irony of "get on your phone to download our app to stay on your phone, because the #1 reason you can't sleep at night is you are on your phone" I don't see how they don't see the irony of this in their advertising, I don't plan to advertise this software at all, except for word-of-mouth, or good community led efforts to advertise)

## Suggestions

Worried about staying up late at night? Most modern devices have a blue light filter, which helps you go to sleep, even if you use your device minutes before bed. Blue light emission from electronic devices keeps you up, the blue light filter filters some of it out. Although not perfect, it will help you sleep.
