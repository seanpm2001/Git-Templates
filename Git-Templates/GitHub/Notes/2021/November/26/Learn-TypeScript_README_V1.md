### Learning TypeScript (programming language)

I know very little about the TypeScript programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the TypeScript programming language.

#### Hello World in TypeScript

This is how you make a Hello World program in TypeScript:

```typescript
var helloWorld:string = "Hello world";
console.log(helloWorld);
```

#### Comments in TypeScript

Comments in TypeScript are identical to comments in Java, JavaScript, C#, etc.

```typescript
// This is a single line comment
/* This
is a multiline
comment */
/* Multi-line comments
* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

#### Break keyword in TypeScript

```typescript
break;
```

To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Other knowledge of the TypeScript programming language

1. TypeScript is a language by Microsoft

2. TypeScript is a semicolon and curly bracket language

3. TypeScript uses the `*.ts` file extension

4. TypeScript was influenced by C#, Java, and JavaScript

5. No other knowledge of the TypeSctipr programming language
