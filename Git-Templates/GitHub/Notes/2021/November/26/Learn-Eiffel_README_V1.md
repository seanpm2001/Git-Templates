### Learning Eiffel (programming language)

I know very little about the Eiffel programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Eiffel programming language.

#### Comments in Eiffel

Comments in Eiffel are similar to those of VHDL.

```eiffel
-- This is a single line comment
-- Eiffel doesn't support multi-line comments as far as I know
```

#### Hello World in Eiffel

This is how you make a basic Hello World program in Eiffel:

```eiffel
class
    eiffelHelloWorld
create
    make
feature
    make
        do
            print ("Hello world")
        end
end
```

#### Program structure in Eiffel

A basic Eiffel program is structured like so:

```eiffel
class
    myEiffelClass
create
    make
feature
    make
        do
            print ("Welcome to Eiffel class")
        end
end
```

#### Classes in Eiffel

Eiffel supports classes. The following program is a duplicate of the above example:

```eiffel
class
    myEiffelClass
create
    make
feature
    make
        do
            print ("Welcome to Eiffel class")
        end
end
```

#### Other knowledge of the Eiffel programming language

1. Eiffel uses the `*.e` file extension

2. Eiffel is NOT a semicolon and curly bracket language

3. Eiffel isn't the most well known language, and isn't well supported

4. No other knowledge of the Eiffel programming language.
