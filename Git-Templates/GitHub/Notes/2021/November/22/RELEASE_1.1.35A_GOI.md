# Version 1.1.35A - 2021 November 22nd

## V1.1.35A

### Changes:

This is the Hundred-seventh release of this project. It contains the basic data for 719 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 107th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V107 and not V108. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

I wasn't completely done with my work yesterday, as I limit myself to 10 new organizations a day. This set of releases finishes up what I was doing.

See below for more changes.
