Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU-Beliefs/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# SNU-Beliefs
The belief center for SNU, a place to safely discuss religion and irreligion. This build is required in certain SNU distributions. Learn how to build SNU here: [https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/745564a46186888e829fdeb9cda584de)

***

## About

See above. This is the place on SNU for religious and irreligious discussion. It is a place that is extra protected against brigades and trolls for safe discussion.

***

## Religions

These are the religions currently supported by SNU Beliefs (as of August 8th 2021)

> Buddhism

> Christian Catholicism (or simply Catholisism)

> Christianity

> Hinduism

> Islam

> Jainism (coming soon)

> Judaism

***

## Irreligions

These are the irreligions currently supported by SNU Beliefs (as of August 8th 2021)

> Agnosticism

> Atheism

***

## Cults

Cults are provided in SNU beliefs for archival purposes. To enable freedom of thought and expression, if you believe that one of the cults in this list is not a cult, you can practice it. Just remember not to cause physical or severe verbal harm to others. Despite the label as a cult, you can still safely discuss the desired religion there, without persecution. A future option for hiding the cult label may be available. <!-- Personal note: I didn't want to do this, but I feel like it is necessary, as it is a human right to think differently, even if that thought may be considered to be incorrect. I also wouldn't be able to fight back against these users, as it would be unethical, and they would fork it and move somewhere else. These will still be protected here. !-->

Cults are defined here based on scientific classifications. If there is an error, a cult will be redirected to the main religion section.

Currently, 2 religions **are** labeled as cults and are being archived, they include:

> Mormonism

> Scientology

Religions and irreligions currently being **considered** for cult status include:

> Norse mythology (it may just be moved to an archived area)

## History

This project has a short history so far.

### Pre-history

This project was started under SNU on {?=version_num_missing} and was designed to be a place for safe religious and irreligious discussion. Cults were not supported at first, and Agnosticism was originally misspelled as Nongelism due to a naming error.

Certain biblical material was included, as it is exempt from copyright, due to its age and nature. Some material wasn't added because it either couldn't be found, or exceeded GitHubs 25 megabyte upload limit, said material remains in the SNU archives.

### Alpha history

This project was moved to GitHub on June 9th 2020 at 6:56 pm as part of my move to GitHub for hosting software projects. The project was worked on on several occassions.

On August 7th 2021, the cults section was defined better, and Mormonism was moved there. Scientology was also added to the cults section, and the irreligion section was better defined. Better isuse labels were created, and the project was modernized.

On August 8th 2021, the project was modernized further. It received a major update to its main `README.md` file, and a website was created for the project.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
