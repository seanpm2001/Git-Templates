The Caml programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

[Support Caml in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/64)

## Doctors notes

[1] Won't spit on you

[2] I think you are thinking about Llamas, Kevin.

[3] Is not a camel... or a llama.

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic Caml script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
