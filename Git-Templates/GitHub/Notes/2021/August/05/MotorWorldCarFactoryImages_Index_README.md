## MotorWorld_CarFactory

I began to play this game again on August 5th 2021, as I started playing this game (Motor World: Car Factory) again tonight, as I wanted to test to see if it still worked. It was a game from my early childhood. Surprisingly, it is still functional. The only annoying part is that it constantly tells me that the game is "not authenticated" which is pretty annoying, but it still lets me play, and hasn't reset my progress yet. It is a Mobage game, and Mobage shut down most of their games in 2015, so this game hasn't been updated in years.

I decided to make this game a 2nd daily game, as the other game (Smurfs Village) doesn't have as much to do, and I want to document this game, as part of my life archive project. It is a good game. - August 5th 2021

I have turned it into an additional daily image project.

## What changed

I haven't played this game in at least 7 years. There hasn't been anything that has changed that I have noticed so far.

## Status

I am still playing the game daily, as of August 5th 2021.
