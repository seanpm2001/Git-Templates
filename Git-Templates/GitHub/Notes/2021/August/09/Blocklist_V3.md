# Blocklist

This is the main blocklist for this project. For now, there is no automated way of blocking, so it needs to be done manually. Luckily, there aren't too many projects that need to be blocked in certain areas.

Additionally, you may want to block the blocklist when you are done

<!--
YAMLAMLAMLAMLAMLAMALAMLAML...YAMLAMLAML...

A curated blocklist for blocking certain content of mine when needed.
!-->

**Note: this is not a full-fledged blocklist. I do not plan on maintaining one. There are many that exist, and I just need to compromise on some things for GitHub in certain countries, so I created a smaller blocklist.**

***

## TODO

- [x] Start the blocklist with a good starter selection

- [ ] Get more links for individual forks/block from the source

- [x] Add support for Gists

- [ ] Find any other projects that may have been missed.

**Total Progress:** `050.000%`

***

## Region notes

All projects listed above should be blocked in China due to Chinese Internet policies

Projects with sexual themes or humor should be blocked in countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.

These projects may need to be blocked for your school district or business/institution for safety and ethical reasons

You shouldn't block GitHub or my account altogether, that would be unfair, cruel censorship, and would make you look really bad. If you really have to, just block my account from your country (I recommend just blocking all the links above if you have to)

***

## Other notes

I don't block any users, I just ignore them if they bug me too much
