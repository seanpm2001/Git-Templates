# Version 1.1.12B - August 15th 2021

## V1.1.12B

### Changes:

This is the sixty-fourth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 646 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 64th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V64 and not V65. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

### Changes

This is version 64, the B variant of version 63 to 64. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data

- [x] Updated release data

- [x] Deleted 1 `IGNORE.md` file

<!-- - [x] Updated Git navigation data

<!-- - [x] Deleted 3 `IGNORE.md` files !-->
