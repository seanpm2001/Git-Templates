# Version 1.1.11A - August 13th 2021

## V1.1.11A

### Changes:

This is the sixty-first release of this project. It contains the basic data for 638 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 61st release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V61 and not V62. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 1 day late, as I didn't have time the previous day to work on the project with the new organization data, as I got so much done and didn't have time for more (I also reached my 25 project limit yesterday)

- [x] Updated discussion data
