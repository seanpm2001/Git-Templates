# Version 1.1.15A - August 27th 2021

## V1.1.15B

### Changes:

This is the sixty-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 651 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 69th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V69 and not V70. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

This set of releases came 2 days late due to recent management and maintenance issues.
