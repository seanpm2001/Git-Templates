[Feature request] Add support for Boolean Algebra. #3 

***

### [Feature request] Add support for Boolean Algebra.

I have noted that this project does not have support for Boolean Algebra. It is something that has got me into this project again.

Up until recently, I was unfamiliar with Boolean Algebra. In my CS classes, I was taught that Booleans only do 2 things, which is return a `true` `(1)` or `false` `(0)` value. I have recently learned that there is more to it, with things like `AND` `NOT` `OR` and `EXCLUSIVE OR`

I will need to learn Boolean Algebra better before I fully implement it, but I have to put this feature request out.

While I am at it, I will also add support for Booleans, as Boolean support is missing.
