# About

UCALC (Ultimate Calculator) is a python based calculator that can do every type of equation. When I worked on the project originally, I was trying to do 2 things alongside the command line version

> 1. Create a GUI version

> 2. Create a version that could run on an actual calculator

If it were to run on an actual calculator, it would make the TI-40 calculators look like primitive technology compared to something millions of years later. I can still get it done someday.

# Fixed issues

~~> * 1. I have 2 huge directories that I couldn't add in tonight. The English directories inside the UCALC Shell/CLI. It was originally a fairly easy process. I would upload them all at once, I could do it in one go. Newer versions had more versions, so I had to do it in multiple batches (due to a 100 file at once upload limit on GitHub) the problem now is that for 2 versions of the English directory, there are several subdirectories, with more subdirectories inside the directories subdirectories. It is going to be a nightmare to get them all uploaded, due to how long it is going to take.~~
