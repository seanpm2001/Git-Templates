Development is resuming #2

### Development is resuming

I have gained interest in this project again, and I intend to take it out of its archived state and continue its development.

There is still a lot to do with this project, it is lacking a bunch of features, and it needs a GUI version.

Some major changes I currently have planned include:

* Making the program fully functional

* Start building the operating system portion (will be Linux based on the lightest distribution I can find)

* Make a complete GUI version of the project

* Making a Snapcraft version of the program for those who need it

* Heavily optimize the source code to make it very lightweight

Some small changes that got me interested again include:

* Add support for Boolean Algebra

* Relearn the source code of the project

This project already has a lot of development time, and it is my most functional software project. I hope that I can get it to a state where it can replace my current system calculator, so that I can use my own software on a daily basis, something I had a major role in developing. It isn't going to be easy, and I am going to need help from some experienced Python developers. But first, I have to relearn how I wrote the source code, and get back into things.
