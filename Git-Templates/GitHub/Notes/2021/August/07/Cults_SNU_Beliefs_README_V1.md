# Cults

## SNU Beliefs

Cults are provided in SNU beliefs for archival purposes. To enable freedom of thought and expression, if you believe that one of the cults in this list is not a cult, you can practice it. Just remember not to cause physical or severe verbal harm to others. Despite the label as a cult, you can still safely discuss the desired religion there, without persecution. A future option for hiding the cult label may be available. <!-- Personal note: I didn't want to do this, but I feel like it is necessary, as it is a human right to think differently, even if that thought may be considered to be incorrect. I also wouldn't be able to fight back against these users, as it would be unethical, and they would fork it and move somewhere else. These will still be protected here. !-->
