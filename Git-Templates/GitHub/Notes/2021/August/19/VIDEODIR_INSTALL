Installing SeansLifeArchive/Extras/VideoDirectory (SeansLifeArchive_VideoDirectory)
---

SeansLifeArchive/Extras/VideoDirectory currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of images, video, and data. It is part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and for proper "installation" the repository should be placed under /SeansLifeArchive/<yourInstalledVersion>/Extras/Videos folder/

Due to link rot, some (or many) of the links provided may not work correctly.

Due to the directory structure, playlist files will require certain modifications and the ownership of the video files in the exact provided structure to work correctly

For Windows users, INI files are included in many directories that were created pre-July 9th 2020. These INI files will provide a folder icon on Windows XP to Windows 10 that makes navigation a lot easier. I am working on a similar method for Linux, MacOS, and BSD.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG format. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle JPG files.

Audio and video files are in a diverse array of formats, including MP4, WEBM, MKV, WMV, and other formats.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and JPG. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
