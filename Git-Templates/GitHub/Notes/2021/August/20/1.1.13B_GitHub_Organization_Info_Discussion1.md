# Version 1.1.13B - August 20th 2021

## V1.1.13B

### Changes:

This is the sixty-sixth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 647 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 66th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V66 and not V67. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

### Changes

This is version 66, the B variant of version 65 to 66. It includes the following changes:

- [x] Updated discussion data

- [x] Updated release data

- [x] Deleted 2 `IGNORE.md` files

<!-- - [x] Updated Git navigation data

<!-- - [x] Deleted 3 `IGNORE.md` files !-->
