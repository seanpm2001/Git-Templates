# Version 1.1.10A - August 10th 2021

## V1.1.10A

### Changes:

This is the fifty-ninth release of this project. It contains the basic data for 637 organizations, <!-- (fork count minus 2) !--> related notes, and images. It is missing data for 2 organizations. This is the actual 59th release. I made a mistake with the 44th release, and upon fixing it, it created a duplicate release. This notice is getting kind of dated (old) but it explains why this is V59 and not V60. I intend to keep it until it makes a large enough dent. For now, I just plan to keep this notice as long as possible.

<!-- This set of releases came 1 day late, as I didn't have time the previous day, as I got so much done and didn't have time for more. !-->
