Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, over 25 translations are out of date and are using Version 8 or Version 9 of this README file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 1st 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

### What I'm currently working on

I have many repositories. The majority of them are sub-projects to a main project (SNU)

My major projects include:

![Original SNU profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it](/Media/71748421.png)

[SNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/) - An advanced website hosting platform, aiming to be the Linux of web development, and an alternate to many sites, including YouTube, Twitter, FaceBook, GitHub, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and hundreds of thousands more.

![Original MEDOS B4.0 profile picture failed to load. Click/tap here to attempt to view it](/Media/MEDOS4_Logo.bmp)

[MEDOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS/) - An older project for a set of operating systems that run directly off external mediums, and can be remotely accessed.

	***

### Degoogle-your-life project

[Degoogle your life](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life) - The main repository in my series of anti-Google campaign article projects. This project ties them all together, and gives general info.

[Why you should stop using Google Chrome](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-stop-using-Chrome) - The first article in my series of degoogle articles, aimed at pointing out problems with Chrome and giving good privacy-respecting alternatives.

[Stop using Chromebooks](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Stop-using-Chromebooks) - The second article in my series of degoogle articles, aimed at pointing out additional problems with Google Chrome, this time with ChromeOS and the dominant privacy-invasive computer devices and peripherols aimed to gather more user data and increasing the Google monopoly. Alternatives are given as well, all articles give alternatives.

[Alternating from YouTube](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Alternating-from-YouTube) - Another article in my series of degoogle articles, aimed at showing the hypocrasy and large bounty of problems (and many deaths + 1 shooting) caused by Google-owned YouTube. Since it is so hard to get away from YouTube due to no viable alternatives, this article lists some alternatives, but mainly lists how you can defend your privacy while still using YouTube, although it also serves as a criticism boatload.

[Degoogled Android phone Virtual Machine research](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogled_Android_Phone_VM_Research) - Unofficially part of my degoogle campaign, this is a project for personal research on creating a fully functional degoogled Android virtual machine.

[Stop Googling - Why you should stop using Google Search](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Stop-Googling--Why-you-should-stop-using-Google-Search) - Another core article in my degoogle campaign, targeting the Google search engine, and showing its flawed history, plus listing alternatives (such as DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, etc.)

### Image projects

[Daily desktop screenshots](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Daily-desktop-screenshots) - My repository for daily desktop screenshots, similar to that of early YouTube videos where people take a picture of themselves every day for x years and make a time lapse. This is similar, but instead of pictures of myself, it is computer desktop screenshots. This repository also hosts my wallpapers that I use.

[LifeArchive Images:GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub) - My repository for my life archive project that hosts GitHub images and screenshots.

[LifeArchive Images:GNOME System Monitor](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_GNOME_System_Monitor) - My repository for my life archive project that hosts my through-out the day and end-of-day GNOME System Monitor screenshots

[LifeArchive Images:Tiny Tower](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyTower) - My repository for my life archive project that hosts my daily Tiny Tower gameplay progress screenshots.

[LifeArchive Images:Jewels (Android game by MHGames)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Jewels_-Android_Game-) - My repository for my life archive project that hosts my daily Jewels (2009 Android game by MHGames) gameplay progress screenshots from September 2020 to January 2021 (where I stopped playing due to my phones power button getting nearly completely destroyed, and the game not working on Android 9 and above)

[LifeArchive project:Khan Academy data](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial) - My repository that hosts my Khan Academy data, but mostly images and documentation of daily Khan Academy progress since 2016.

### Life archive projects

[LifeArchive project:Daily articles](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Daily-articles) - A repository that hosts my daily articles for my journaling. For now, until May 2040, only certain data is included, and most of the journaling is not due to privacy and readiness reasons.

[LifeArchive project:My Linux Setup](https://github.com/seanpm2001/My-Linux-setup) - A project that hosts my Linux setup information.

[LifeArchive project:SPM FOod index](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SPM_FoodIndex) - A web application (which is also fully functional offline) that contains info on my views of food and drinks, along with a categorized list of all the food and drinks that I eat (I am a very picky eater, so there are less than 160 total entries.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Since nobody has asked any questions yet, I will list some common ones here:

<details>
	<summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Frequently Asked Questions board list]</summary>
	
	***

### Why is Python your favorite programming language

See below for the full store. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

### What got you into programming

In 2015, I was switched from an incorrect class to a class I was supposed to be in, which changed my life completely: my 2015 Middle School computer programming class.

Although the class mainly just used Scratch, this is where my interest skyrocketed. I was a big user of Scratch, and eventually got into real programming after transitioning to Python in my first AP computer science class. I really came to love Python, and I have the most knowledge in it out of other programming languages (markdown and markup languages (like HTML or Markdown) are not included in this summary)

### How well can you program in Java

I took an AP Java class, but I was missing too many stepping stones to fully get it. I did get several concepts of it, and this class familiarized me with Java quite a bit, along with using IDEs (Eclipse) I am not too good at Java, but I can do some basic stuff, not just Hello World programs. I can't write an entire program in Java though, I feel like my knowledge of Java basics and intermediate is 2.8%

### Why do you use so many different programming languages

I have always been a linguist. I like the looks of all the different programming languages and their syntax. Also, some projects are dependant on some languages. When I create an IDE out of a language, I prefer to use that language to emulate that language.

### Do you actually know all those languages

I know a few, but can't do more than the very basics in most. Languages I am good at include Python, BASH, HTML5, and Java.

### Why do you put so much info out

I have had years of decisions on what info I put out and what I don't put out. All data put out is thought out for 30 minutes to 5 years beforehand.

### Why do you have image projects? Doesn't that defeat the point of GitHub

It does in a way, but I don't have any good image platforms. Since GitHub is a version control site, and I add in content besides images, it fits pretty well, other than proper image viewing without downloading the repository.

### Why are so many projects of yours so underdeveloped

I joined GitHub with the goal of collaboration. I am still building a following, and hope to have developers contributing to these projects based on their interest level in the project. There are so many of them, as I have been going through and adding new ideas as they come up.

### How are you profitable

I am not profitable yet, but I am working on it. Since I work in the FOSS industry, I rely on donations and sponsors. I will try to limit my usage of ads (and I will not make sketchy, crappy ads like Playrix's homescape, gardenscape, etc. ads, or ads like about 99.998% of the ads on Google Play)

### Why did you switch to Linux

Linux is great. I have had a really, really horrible experience with Windows 10, there is too much to get into. I intended to start with Fedora Linux, but I had to go with Ubuntu 20.04, as I feared that I might void my laptops warranty (which I don't want to do, since this laptop costs over $1.4K)

### What is the purpose of the life archive project

My life archive project is a full-time hobby project where I archive my entire life.

### Why did you follow over 1000 users one night

I have been trying to gain followers on GitHub so that I eventually get someone to help interact with me on my projects. It has been a very slow process.

I got my account suspended 3 days later, and along with other reasons, I decided not to do this again. All I had to do to unsuspend my account was re-verify my email address.

### Why do you have so many tabs open

I have a lot of different projects. I have to manage lots of different projects. I have over 70 different Firefox profiles, each one containing their own set of tabs, however I only keep 1-3 profiles open at once. I close out of these when I finish with them for now.

### Why do you use Wikipedia so much

Wikipedia is one of my most used sites, GitHub is second. I find Wikipedia to be a great resource, and good for researching programming, chemistry, history, and more. I intend to start donating money to Wikipedia monthly some day. 

### Why do you play so many different games

I like to have balance in my life, and have periods to relax from programming. I come up with new ideas during this time period as well, and do other things, such as chores around the house.

### Why do you play kids games

I play games that have a general target of kids, but are also just past-time games. Examples include Restaurant/Bakery/Pet Shop/Fashion/Farm/City story, and Merge Plane. These games can be for both kids and adults. I played these games in my childhood, and have nostalgic ties to them. Some of them are just genuinely fun to begin with.

### Why do you hate Google so much

Google has a long history of privacy invasion, hypocrasy, being a monopoly, killing off parts of the Internet, and more. I turned against Google in 2018.

### Why do some of your projects use Go, Dart, or Flutter when you hate Google

I don't write the entire project in this language, and in the cases I do, it is required for archiving the data and making an IDE (SNU_2D_Programming_Tools) or just a general pun. The 1 project that uses it but is using a degoogled version [(Candroid)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Candroid)

Also, a few projects are written in Go! (a language that came out over 4 years before Go) its creator got steamrolled and no-one ever really looks at his language due to Googles claim that Go! won't be confused with Go, and that "lots of other projects and languages have the same name" which is not true, Google. You steamrolled him.

Since Go! (2004) and Go (2008/2009) both use the .go file extension, GitHub's lingust feature identifies it as Go instead of Go! Both languages vary significantly in Syntax.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

### What I'm currently learning

It isn't exact, I have many interests. What I am always learning include:

* World history

* Computer Programming and computer history

* The languages of the world (linguistics)

* Virtualization

* Solutions to major world problems

* Pre-history

* Psychology

* Current world problems

* Other (non-culinary)

### What I'm looking to collaborate on

I currently need a technical job. I am willing to work on any ethical computer project, as long as it is written in a language I know well (Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Lisp, Markdown, XML, Shell, or any/all of the ones listed)

<details>
	<summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse further collaboration info]</summary>
	
***

Companies I refuse to work for include:

> Google

> Facebook

> Zoom technologies

> Spectrum Enterprise

> Clever

> No other companies currently listed

Companies I am currently considering include:

> Microsoft [::] - I have some family that works here, and I have had a long past with Microsoft (all the way back to 2005) even though I consider some things Microsoft does as unethical, I wouldn't mind working here (I have a very strong personal experience with Microsoft products, notably Windows XP) If there are any jobs here that use Python, I can do them.

> VideoLan /-\ - I would like to try and write documentation for VideoLan, I am very good at writing documentation, as I enjoy doing it, and I do it most of the day, every day. Currently, VideoLan is unable to have documentation writers due to low amounts of volunteers. If allowed, I will write documentation for every version of VLC that doesn't have it (only in English, I can't do other languages)

> Canonical (&) - I would like to try and contribute to Linux in any way I can. Working at Canonical is currently an option, I don't know exactly what I would do here, but I could hopefully do something.

> The KDE Foundation (K) - KDE would be a nice foundation to work for. I really love their super lightweight open source projects, and I could help reduce even more bloat. If a job is available in a language I have at least 40% knowledge in, I could work here.

> Khan Academy (^) - I would like to help contribute to Khan Academy, I have used the site for nearly 4 years straight on a daily basis. If it would be possible to make videos and articles for them, I have always considered starting a course on virtualization.

> The GNOME organization (G) - if possible, I could try and set some changes to reduce the huge memory usage of GNOME, that has always stuck out as something that needs to be fixed to me. It is still a lot better than Windows 10s memory usage, idle on Windows 10 would use half my RAM, no matter how much I had (4, 8, 16 GB) on my first Linux laptop, it has always stayed below 1.8 gigabytes when idle (also counting the system monitor)

> No other companies currently listed

### What I'm looking to help with

I will do free technical support for you, or programming related work in my scope of knowledge. I do this on my own time, so I can only help a certain amount of people a day. Before trying to ask for my technical support, try the following to troubleshoot:

> `CTRL` + `Z` - Undoes your last mistake

> Restart your computer

I charge money for technical support ($5.00 per hour) if I have to do these steps more than 3 times in a year for 1 person.

**Some limitations**

I cannot do projects unless the scripts are on GitHub or SourceForge already.

I also can't work on projects that are related to your school work. Please do not ask me to do your school work for you. We could both get in trouble for this.

I would prefer to help with projects written in Python 3, Markdown, HTML5, CSS3, Java, C, C++, or JavaScript. I won't be able to help as well with projects written in other languages.

No other limitations listed at the moment.

### Feature requests for GitHub

There are some features that would be nice for GitHub. They include:

**Entries marked with `⭐` are highest priority**

> * The ability to follow organizations ⭐

> * An increased file upload size (25 MB > 50 MB or higher) so that larger files can be uploaded, including maximum size Scratch 1, 2, and 3 projects ⭐

<!-- > * A built-in dark mode, along with other modes (if needed) This was added over 6 months ago, and should now be commented out) !-->

> * Adding back the ability to hover over and see commit percentages ⭐

> * Support for Go! (2004 language by Francis McCabe) (to distinguish from Go (2009 Google language))

> * No other requests at the moment

### How to reach me

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted. Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)

* Through Discord (server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/) - currently inactive on the subreddit, but I will likely respond to a reply or DM within 48 hours

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me

### Projects on other platforms

I have been using GitHub for software development since May 25th 2020, but I have been programming since early 2016.

On December 21st 2020, I created accounts on SourceForge, GitLab, and BitBucket. I currently don't maintain any projects there at the moment, GitHub still is the powerhouse.

[SourceForge link](https://sourceforge.net/u/seanpm2001/profile/)

[GitLab link](https://gitlab.com/seanpm2001)

[BitBucket link](https://bitbucket.org/seanpm2001/)

When I joined GitHub, I also intended to use other platforms as well, as something could always go wrong with my account or GitHub itself, and it isn't smart to rely on a single source for everything.

Now, if GitHub is having problems or if you have problems with GitHub, my projects are viewable on 3 other platforms. Unfortunately, they are still only on GitHub, as I don't have enough developers to manage 4 platforms at once, I will eventually mirror my projects over.

### Identity theft

To avoid possible identity theft, I will link to all the services I use here.

I am on the following platforms

[Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/seanwallawalla) - Although I don't post very often

[Discord](#How-to-reach-me) - Note: as of February 2021, I no longer use Discord

[GitHub](https://github.com/seanpm2001) - Obviously

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/seanwallawalla) - Main channel, abandoned in 2018

* [YouTube second channel](#Identity-theft)

* Other

[Mozilla](#Identity-theft)

[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@seanwallawalla) - No longer use as of 2018, slightly cringy, but not too bad

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanspokane2015) - No longer use as of 2017

* [Scratch attempted main account](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/seanwallawalla) - Also no longer in use

* Other?

You won't find me on Facebook

Not F'd

</details>

This sticker is supported by [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) to protest Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other Facebook products.

[Facebook](#Identity-theft) - Hardly ever used (less than 3 hours total usage) abandoned since 2015 due to a lack of interest, and also forgetting the password

[Yelp](#Identit-theft) - Link is incomplete

[Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) - Link is incomplete

[Bandcamp](https://seanwallawalla.bandcamp.com/releases) - My only way of earning money online at the moment

[Quora](https://www.quora.com/seanwallawalla) - Used infrequently, but I never post here

[Go90](https://www.example.com) - Created an account, barely attempted to use, but the service has been shut down for over 2 years, so you can't really access it anymore (I doubt it has been crawled by the wayback machine)

[Ditty.it](https://www.example.com) - Created and exported all videos, used daily for a while, but the service has been shut down for over 2 years, so you can't really access it anymore (I doubt it has been crawled by the wayback machine)

**List is incomplete. Try bugging me to fix it. I will eventually when I have time, but I might not get to it soon enough.**

However, I am not on other platforms. If you see someone posing on me on other platforms, don't take their word, as they are commiting identity theft. _Identity theft is not a joke Jim. Millions of families suffer every year_ - Dwight Shrute (The Office, US version) [YouTube link is you prefer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f5ni0zpl5E) [Vimeo link, but without the official video, just audio and text](https://vimeo.com/464892816) in all seriousness, Identity theft is an actual problem.

Popular platforms I am not on:

[TikTok](https://tiktok.com) - I am not on TikTok for multiple reasons. The 2 main reasons why I never use TikTok are:

1. It has a plethora of privacy issues and is fully owned by a Chinese company

2. I don't have an interest in this type of video platform

### Personal

I have some personal opinions on GitHub. I am working on keeping them contained inside 3 repositories:

[Opinions](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Opinions/) - Opinions are documented here

[Politics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Politics/) - My political views are listed here and should absolutely NOT leak anywhere else. I felt like I needed to make the point that I wouldn't stay silent on some things.

> Sub project: [Pro-fascist or Anti-fascist](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Profa_Or_Antifa/) - A small political project educating people on the difference between being pro-fascist (supporting dictators) and anti-fascist (opposing dictators)

[Sexuality center](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_SexualityCenter/) - For my sexual views and preferences.

On GitHub, I have a lot of other personal projects, under the category of a life archive project, which I have been working on extra hard since 2016.

### Autism

I am on the Autism spectrum. I am on the high functioning part of the spectrum, only suffering from socialization issues (which have gotten much better over my lifetime)

I don't consider my Autism to be a handicap. I feel like it is what makes me, me, and what makes me so outgoing, creative, and smart.

However, there are less fortunate people with Autism who have much more problems due to their position on the spectrum. That is why I have created the [United Autism Rights organization](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80805036?s=60&v=4) as [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#View_of_autism_as_a_disease)[u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks#Cure_Autism_Now)[t](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/10/disability-community-condemns-autism-speaks/)[i](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/07/health.medicineandhealth)[s](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger)[m](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/25/they-don-t-want-an-autism-cure.html) [S](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0824-silberman-autism-speaks-20150824-story.html)[p](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/aspergers-alive/201311/reporters-guide-the-autism-speaks-debacle)[e](https://web.archive.org/web/20180615032203/https://www.autismspeaks.org/blog/2015/08/25/call-unity)[a](https://web.archive.org/web/20070630013301/http://www.gettingthewordout.org/home.php)[k](https://web.archive.org/web/20071018030910/http://gettingthetruthout.org/)[s](https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19726414.300-voices-of-autism-silenced-by-charity.html) is NOT helpful at all, and the other alternates currently aren't that effective.

### Linux

<details>
	<summary>[Click/tap here to expand/collapse my Linux story]</summary>

I was a fan of Windows up until Windows 10. I began to try to switch to Linux from 2018 to 2020. On July 9th 2020, I finally switched to Linux, getting my first Dell laptop with Linux pre-installed.

![20200709_124359.jpg](/Media/20200709_124359.jpg)

My first full on Linux operating system (other than Android 1.6) is Ubuntu 20.04. I am a very proud Linux user, as I am no longer constrained my forced updates, proprietary software and licensing, lack of control and customization, the fear of instability, and other issues I had with Windows 10. As of March 4th 2021, I am still using Linux on a daily basis, but my fear of Blue Screens has not gone away, sometimes even fearing I got a blue screen when I know that isn't even technically possible on Ubuntu (unless you had software that mimicks it) I originally was going to install Fedora 32 on my laptop when I got it, but I decided to give Ubuntu a try first. So far, I have liked it, except for 2 things: Snaps being proprietary, and the ugliness of GNOME 3.x (compared to earlier versions and other desktop environments, like the one I wanted but haven't installed yet; KDE)

## Submissions

I am open for accepting submissions for project artwork. I would like to receive skeumorphism and 3D designs for program graphics before I accept flat design and solid color works. I want to give people the option for both skeumorphism, 3D, 2D, Flat, solid color, or whatever the user prefers. I want to start with Skeumorphism, as it is the best (totally not an unbiased opinion)

My recommended formats are SVG (60% recommended) and PNG (40% recommended) for images. Non-graphical submissions can be in any format, as long as it is an open format and is not proprietary (for example: Jade programs are proprietary and currently can't be accepted)

***

## Other hobbies

This is a list of my other hobbies

### Photography

I am a intermediate photographer, and can take really good pictures without the need of manipulating the original image to make it better (other than the times I accidentally get my thumb in the shot) I can take photos for you when needed. My current camera is 4K (2160p, or 2K) 60 frames per second.

### Swimming

I have always liked to swim. When I have a pool or hot tub available to me, I normally swim in it.

### Gaming

I am an avid video game player, playing various video games to pass time, relax, have fun, and come up with new ideas. I am also a card game player, but I need extra help playing most card games due to a learning curve and limited knowledge on card games.

### Graphic design

I am an entry-level graphic designer with a large preference for skeumorphism and 3D design with gradients and patterns. I have taken a few graphic design glasses and can create computer graphics using GIMP, MS-PAINT, Blender 2.79, InkScape, Adobe PhotoShop CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe Animate CS6, 2015, CC 2017, Adobe InDesign CC 2017, Adobe Illustrator CC 2017, BYOB 1.x, and Scratch 2.

### Linguist

I have been a linguist since my early childhood. I jokingly changed my middle name to `language` in my early childhood, but I think it would fit as a 2nd middle name.

I like the look and sound of various languages, whether they are human spoken or machine instructions. Unfortunately, I can't write completely in a language other than English, Python, HTML, or markdown.

### History buff

I am a history buff, with knowledge of history spanning back over 13.8 billion years ago (Big Bang) to the current day. I like to learn about history, and I have knowledge of a large assortment of eras and events, including extensive knowledge of things other than World War I or World War II (but I also still know a lot about the 2 world wars) for Earth history, my knowledge goes back to 8000 BCE in extensive detail, down to 27000 BCE in less detail, and mostly geological events before 27000 BCE. I like to learn all types of history, and not just the history of warfare.

I owe my interest in history to my first High School history teacher, who was really enthusiastic about what he was teaching, and was just a general awesome and nice history teacher. I would no doubt make him teacher of the year for that year of High School. Past history classes never got me too into the subject of history, but this one really opened my mind to history.

### Marine biology

I recently got back into Marine Biology on March 23rd 2021, and have been learning the subject part-time again. I find it really calming and nostalgic.

### Journaling

I keep a daily journal. I have been on and off with this for most of my childhood, until sticking with it every day since September 26th 2016.

The journaling project is part of my life archive project, a digital archive of my entire life.

### Vexillology

![fotw-pgr.gif](/Media/fotw-pgr.gif)

This is the flag of the Internet, by [FOTW.info](https://www.fotw.info/flags/fotwprfl.html)

Vexillology is the research and study of flags. I have an interest in Vexillology and I enjoy reading about, documenting, and creating flags.

## Computer user type

- [ ] Low usage - I use the computer very infrequently

- [ ] Novice - I use the computer sometimes

- [ ] Average - I use the computer at an average usage

- [ ] Savvy - I use the computer in a Savvy way

- [ ] Power user - I use the computer heavily, but not in a savvy way

- [x] Power user + savvy - I am the type of computer user who uses the computer constantly (over 8 hours per day) and I am extremely tech savvy and experienced. I also use the computer and push it to its very limits at all times of day, wearing down even the most durable computers in less than a year.

***

## Education

I have completed primary (pre-school, Elementary School) and secondary education (Middle School, High School) I have not yet attempted tertiary education (College/University) because I feel it is too expensive in the US and wouldn't suit me well. I would like to push for a PhD, but I would have to move to Germany, France, Wales, Finland, Sweden, or Switzerland to do so. I am still working on my portfolio too.
