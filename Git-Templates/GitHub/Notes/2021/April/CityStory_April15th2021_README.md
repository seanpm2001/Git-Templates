# City Story session April 15th 2021

I played for a little bit today, and made some progress. I was a bit distracted while playing, as I was preparing my laptop and my notes.

## Production

I produced 5 batches of jewelry, and tons of popsicles today.

## Neighbors

I gifted and visited all my neighbors today, and cleaned every building that I could.

## Expansion

I bought the 15x15 city expansion today for 200000 coins. I will start working on filling all the spaces in now.

## Overview

See above.
