# Tiny Death Star session April 16th 2021

I had a little bit of a longer session today, but did the usual things I do.

## Collection

I did the usual collection today.

## Assignments

I received 2 new assignments today, the same as the ones I completed last time.

## Hiring

I mixed up the name for one of the Bitizens dream jobs and assigned a Bitizen to a floor I have been saving for dream jobs. I decided to just hire 8 more workers and begin stocking these floors today.

## Overview

See above.
