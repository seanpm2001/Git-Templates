# Hay Day session April 25th 2021

I had a long Hay Day session again today.

## Farm

I worked a lot on my farm today.

### Boosts

I used a 15% XP boost today, I used it a little late, and could have gotten more XP if used before starting collection.

### Crops

I grew the usual crops today in mass quantity, especially wheat, carrots, and sugarcane. I also collected from fruit trees and berry bushes, revived some, and cut some down. I am low on saws, so I couldn't cut all the dead trees down.

### Production

I did production in almost all production buildings today, as I didn't produce anything in the ice cream maker.

### Mining

I briefly did some mining today, I have stopped hoarding ingots completely now, and am a lot more willing to turn it into jewelery or just sell it.

### Roadside shop

I sold tons of product in the roadside shop today, but was unable to make it back to where I was.

### Truck orders

I was able to do 3-4 truck orders today, but only did one, as I didn't want to waste town supplies.

### Bee farming

I did some honey farming today, and collected 3 honeycombs. A few pollen bushes died and had to be revived.

### Level progress

I leveled up from level 39 to level 40 today, and unlocked some new things.

### Ranching

I did some ranching with various animals today, but didn't help my chickens or goats today (didn't re-feed them)

## Fishing

I briefly played in the fishing area today.

### Fishing

I fished in 2 fishing spots with normal lures to get rid of them.

### Netfishing

I collected several fish fillet with 3 fish nets today.

### Stock reduction

I reduced my stock on normal lures by 2. I am continuing to reduce 

## Town

I played a bit in the town today.

### Visitors

I served several visitors today and reached reputation level 5.

### Level 5

I leveled up to reputation level 5 today, and built a bed n breakfast, which will be ready on my next session.

### Sanctuary

The sanctuary wasn't very interesting today. The 1 wheat stock only grants 25 xp, and the hippo doesn't do much.

I cut down many weeds in the sanctuary today, and explored the new region, as the sanctuary got a big update today.

## Overview

See above.
