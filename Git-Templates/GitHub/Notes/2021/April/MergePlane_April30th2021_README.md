# Merge Plane session April 30th 2021

I had a very short session today and did less merging. The games leaderboard finally broke, I knew it would at some point, although it may not be broken, as my other apps weren't detecting my stable Wi-Fi/Cellular data connection either. Android has weird network problems with no good advice on fixes.

## Overview

See above.
