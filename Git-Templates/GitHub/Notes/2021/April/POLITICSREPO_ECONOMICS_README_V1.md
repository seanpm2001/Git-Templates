# Economic views

These are my 3 main economic views.

## Capitalism

I am not very supportive of Capitalism, as it often goes unregulated, and unregulated Capitalism in my opinion (and factually) is heavily flawed, and has caused many problems in the world that we still see today (such as Google, Nestlé, and many others)

## Socialism

I am in support of Democratic Socialism, but less so Communism, as I haven't seen any Communist countries live up to what the Communist Manifesto proposed. Unregulated Capitalism in my opinion (and factually) is heavily flawed, and has caused many problems in the world that we still see today (such as Google, Nestlé, and many others)
