# Restaurant Story session April 22nd 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made many batches of bacon and eggs, and I chose to also make Chicken and Dumplings instead of Bagels today.

I ended up extending the session a little bit.

## Remodeling

I took out the plant pattern, as it looked too close to nearly half of a Swastika. Since this game plays at a 45 degree layout, this would be the bad swastika, and not the good swastika. The design was replaced with more tables.

## Overview

See above.
