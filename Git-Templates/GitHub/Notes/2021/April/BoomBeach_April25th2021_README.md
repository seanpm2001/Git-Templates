# Boom Beach session April 25th 2021

I had a long Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today.

### Submarine

I went for a dive with the submarine that will be ready next week.

### Power stones

I converted many power stones today, but didn't place any new statues.

### Upgrades

I had difficulty doing upgrades today. I upgraded my vault to level 19 today, but wanted to do so many other upgrades. I hope this vault upgrade will help prevent some of my revenue from being stolen. I also upgraded my shock bomb to level 6 today.

## Battles

I did many battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and lost 1 scorcher on the last battle. I didn't make very much profit from it.

### Dr Terror Hasty Crab

I defeated the first 12 stages of Dr. Terrors Hasty Crab today, and lost my last 4 scorchers on the last battle. I made lots of profit from this.

## Overview

See above.
