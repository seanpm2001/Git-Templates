# Space race

I fear who gets to space first. A corporation getting into space would have dangerous consequences, for example, almost any science fiction movie regarding space. Science fiction becomes nonfiction pretty frequently. It would be completely unregulated up there, and we might end up with thousands of gas stations on the moon, a TESLA galactic government, and more slavery, as there wouldn't be any regulation. Unspeakable things could be done with no consequence.
