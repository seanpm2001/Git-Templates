# AdVenture Capitalist session April 17th 2021

I had an average session today, and played for a bit, as I was trying to get a functional SD card at the time. I collected and worked on the 3 normal planets, and played for an extended time in the event, but not too far.

## Earth

I briefly collected from Earth today, and activated all ad boosts. I didn't make much progress here today.

## Moon

I made some progress on the moon today, but decided not to do an angel claim yet, as there weren't enough angels to be gained yet. I briefly collected from here, and made little progress.

## Mars

I did collection and upgrades to mars today, but swapped to the event several times as I waited for the last industry to get close enough to boost. I made some progress.

## Capitalist Cakeday Event

I played the Capitalist Cakeday to get the gold reward, and a 3rd anniversary badge, but not long enough to go further and get the time warp express. I wanted to have fun and wrap up at this point.

## Overview

See above.
