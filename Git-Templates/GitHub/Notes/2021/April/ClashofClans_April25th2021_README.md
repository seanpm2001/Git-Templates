# Clash of Clans session April 25th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started many upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am starting to consider making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started last Sunday, and it got stronger this Sunday)

## Main village

I did some upgrades in the main village, beginning an upgrade on an archer tower to level 11, my 3rd dark elixir drill to level 6, and my air defense to level 7. I am getting very close to all level 9+ walls, with less than 10 to go, at 250,000 gold or elixir each. I plan on upgrading my air defense, cannons, and certain other defenses next.

## Builder base

I made some progress on the builder base today. I am saving up to unlock upgrades to unlock O.T.T.O and today, I began upgrading my final elixir collector to max level, as I still had 1 that needed to be maxed out, and I wanted to still save some gold for the mega tesla level 2 upgrade (3.1M coins) I activated the clock tower boost a bit late today.

### Battles

Today, I didn't just do night witch spam like I normally do. I tried 1 attack strategy for 1 battle that had too high of an air defense level to do all night witch spam, I used 2 night witches, 100 raged barbarians, and of course, my battle machine. The attack was successful. All other attacks were done with all night witches. 

## Overview

See above.
