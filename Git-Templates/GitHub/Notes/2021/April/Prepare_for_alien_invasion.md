What to do before Alien contact

1. Consider being more advanced: maybe physics and science must be redone

2. Languages could be a threat to them

3. Prepare for an invasion, they might have come thousands of pascals away for a resource, and they are likely very technologically strong to have made it this far

4. More reasons here

I don't know why I thought of this, probably too much Science Channel in the background yesterday.
