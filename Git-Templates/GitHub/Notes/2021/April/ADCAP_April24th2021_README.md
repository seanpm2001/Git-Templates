# AdVenture Capitalist session April 24th 2021

I had an average session today, and played for a normal but shortened duration. I made minor progress.

## Earth

I briefly collected from Earth today, and activated only 2 ad boosts. I didn't make much progress here today.

## Moon

I made some progress on the moon today, and did an angel claim. I will work on increasing the profit per angel, and other multipliers, as it is what is keeping me from a fully maxed out moon.

## Mars

I did collection and upgrades to mars today, but activated my martian boost early, as I didn't want to play an extra 12 minutes here today.

## Cashella Event

I played the Cashella event to get the gold reward, and a music badge, but not long enough to go further and get the time warp express. I wanted to have fun and wrap up at this point, and I wanted to get to the badge, but the game stopped functioning, so I quit early. Luckily this ended todays addiction.

## Overview

See above.
