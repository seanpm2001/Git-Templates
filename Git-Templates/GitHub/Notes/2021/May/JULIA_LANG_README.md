# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Julia-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Julia.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Julia-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Julia-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Julia. The original rule was that Julia had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Julia code is included.
