# City Story session May 20th 2021

I had a usual session today. I did the usual jewelery box production, tip collection, and friend visits. I quit after production was complete. I played ~5.3 minutes extra, so that I could level up to level 16. I didn't receive a full factory bonus today, as none of my factories get cleaned.

I also experimented with the games built-in camera. I initially thought it was useless, but it can get pictures without the games HUD (Heads-Up Display) so it can be useful.

## Overview

See above.
