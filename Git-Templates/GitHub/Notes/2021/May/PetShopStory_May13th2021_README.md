# Pet Shop Story session May 13th 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection, and requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did 3 more just for the heck of it. Everyone I have "friended" seems to be extremely inactive. The game had no difficulties loading again today. I omitted 2 extra collections from todays session.

## Overview

See above.
