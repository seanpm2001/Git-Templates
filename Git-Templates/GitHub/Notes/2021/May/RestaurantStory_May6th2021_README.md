# Restaurant Story session May 6th 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 3 batches of bacon and eggs, and I chose to also make Chicken and Dumplings instead of Bagels again today.

The game did not crash today. Not much was done, I was trying to brush past the gameplay today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
