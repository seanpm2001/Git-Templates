# Bit City session May 18th 2021

I had a long Bit City session today. Originally, I was just going to quit and wrap up early, but I had a good time playing. My session was cut into 2 parts due to a doctors appointment.

I built several new structures today, and passed 700,000 population.

<!--

## Upgrades

I upgraded the bank today, but that was it.

### Common upgrades

I finished off the rest of the tier 8 common upgrades today, now having all upgrades in city 8. It will be much easier to get them back when prestiging.

### Epic upgrades

I bought 1 "keeper of keys" upgrade today, adding 10% keys to my next prestige. It didn't add as many as I thought it would.

## Building

I constructed dozens of buildings today, and made a lot of progress here. I am up to a population of 512000 now (512000 - 511488 = 512 (16 * 32 = 512)) a unique number in mathematics and computing.

## Cars

I bought 1 set of 8 cars today to increase production.

## Double time

I used the double time boost at least 3 times today to make gameplay a bit faster, but I didn't use it over 60% of the time.

## Play duration

I played for over 60 minutes today.

## Overview

See above.
