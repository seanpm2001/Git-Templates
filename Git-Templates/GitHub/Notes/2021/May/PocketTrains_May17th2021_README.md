# Pocket Trains session May 17th 2021

I had an extremely long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made some significant progress today due to converting over 1550 bux to coins, and unlocking nearly every last city in the game. There isn't much else to unlock. I split my session into 2 parts today, part 1 was the longest and came before my medical appointment, part 2 was the shortest, and came after.

## New railroads

I built 3 new railroads today to have more unique railroad types. I am starting to worry that there isn't enough of a map to have 1 of every train type actively and correctly going across the world.

## Bux

I saved up about 50 bux today after spending it all on over half a million coins (the bank had a good transfer rate today, and I wanted to get better progress)

## Asia exploration

I explored South America extensively today and earned the Asia monopoly award.

## South America exploration

I explored South America extensively today and earned the South America monopoly award.

## Oceania exploration

I explored Oceania extensively today and earned the Oceania monopoly award.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progress on this goal again today.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to expenses, but I didn't do well on this goal today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I did not level up today. I made significant progress on level 13 though.

## Overview

See above.
