### Status update: May 21st 2021

🎂 **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `04` _(as of May 21st 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a very good day with development today, and a very good day overall.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and briefly did some project planning. I made massive progress in GitHub organization documentation work, and other documentation work. I am considering another renewal into Degoogle work, I found a good resource (`The social Dilemma` which ironically is on Netflix, and Netflix is not innocent from the subject of the documentary) I am considering making some Wikiversity-inspired edits to my Degoogle articles, and add this as a `multimedia` source. It does a pretty good job at making an overview of the problem with our cyber society, that needs to become a cyberpunk society) I am still going on with this, and I am considering going against more evil, but for now, I feel like I should stick with DeGoogling, as I have the most knowledge regarding this subject, and a "war" against Amazon and Facebook doesn't seem necessary yet to me. Personally, I was able to De-facebook within a week, over 3 years before I began DeGoogling. I never got into Facebook luckily.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done. I am close to halfway now. I have been struggling to write a status file for all the organizations, I made significant progress on this today, but didn't reach the halfway caught-up point. I was laser-focused today, and was able to do lots of work, despite 4 system crashes. Due to this, I plan on doing a hard drive backup tomorrow and going back to my original laptop.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize.

I skipped marine biology work again today, and wrapped up earlier. I plan on going to bed earlier. I got a pretty good amount of work done today. I am hoping it isn't harder to do so again tomorrow. I am now 3 days behind with Marine Biology work.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a very good day for development
