# Clash of Clans session May 30th 2021

I had a very long session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 6 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 5 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official 2 Sundays (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it)

## Main village

I did 4 upgrades in my main village, upgrading my geared up cannon to level 12, upgrading a bomb to level 7, upgrading my Archer Queen to level 17, and upgrading a dark elixir drill to level 7. I did better this week in terms of upgrades, but I am still actively being successfully raided.

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I wasn't able to do the Mega Tesla or Cannon Cart upgrades, so for now, I upgraded one of my gold storage buildings to MAX level 9.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today, with a mix of 2 skeleton balloons. It works, but isn't always effective because it is too low level. Nevertheless, I still used it today, it is useful in some situations. I stopped using the skeleton balloon in later attacks, and also had to lose several attacks to be able to successfully get all 6 wins today.

## Overview

See above.
