# Boom Beach session May 9th 2021

I had a normal length Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I was not able to come very close to any upgrades today. I have 2 more sniper towers that need to be upgraded to level 19, but I am considering trying to save up and upgrade my headquarters to level 20 due to many benefits (such as the last landing craft being unlocked, more upgrades being unlocked, new defenses, a new troop, and more health to the headquarters.

### Submarine

I went for a dive with the submarine that will be ready next week. I received a decent reward from last weeks voyage.

### Power stones

I converted 14 power stones today, but didn't place any new statues. I am considering starting to strategize my statue construction.

### Upgrades

I had difficulty doing upgrades today. I wasn't able to do any, and it is really difficult to save up for them. Recent attacks against my base resulted in some loot lost, but not enough to prevent me from getting close to upgrading.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 4 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't make very much profit from it.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players.

## Overview

See above.
