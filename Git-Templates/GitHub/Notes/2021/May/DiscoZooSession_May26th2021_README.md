# Disco Zoo session May 26th 2021

I had a long session today. I spent nearly all my coins rescuing animals in the Jungle today, so I can make progress and get closer to unlocking a time machine. I also decided to spend 1 discobux to start a disco to make all my animals fully awake before quitting, and to see what it was like again. I have stopped considering making this game a daily game, deciding against it. Jungle rescues became extremely expensive.

## Jungle

I went and rescued over 20 animals in the Jungle region today. I spent over 70000 coins doing rescues in the Jungle.

## Overview

See above.
