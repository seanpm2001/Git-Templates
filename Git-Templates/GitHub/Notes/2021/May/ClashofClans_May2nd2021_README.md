# Clash of Clans session April 25th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started many upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am starting to consider making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 2 Sundays ago, and it got stronger last Sunday)

## Main village

I did some upgrades in the main village, beginning an upgrade on a cannon to level 12 (although I regret not doing the upgrade to my geared up cannon) I also began upgrading my barbarian king to level 24. I also upgraded one of my dark elixir drills to level 7 for 2.4 million elixir.

### Decade wall progress

I have been playing Clash of Clans for about a decade (I remember playing in 4th grade) and I remember back then when I was excited to start getting level 5 and level 6 walls. After about 10 years and 1 full game restart (switched from iOS 6 to Android 5.0 at around 2014 CE or 2015 CE) today I finally got all my walls to level 9 or higher. Now I just have to get them to level 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and whatever else wall level gets added and when (15+)

## Builder base

I made some progress on the builder base today. I am saving up to unlock upgrades to unlock O.T.T.O and today, I began to upgrade my mega tesla to level 2 for 3.1 million coins, along with my cannon cart to level 13. I did pretty well in battles at first, and made it close to 3000 trophies again, but then I started facing difficult opponents.

### Battles

I did night witch spam battles today, as it is my best strategy in the builder base, and the quickest way to start a battle. A major key I have noticed in builder base battles is that you have to start as quickly as possible to prevent the other player from being able to 100% you while you 100% and still win (due to time differences) I feel like this may be an anti-competitive thing for top builder base bases. Night witches take the least amount of time to prepare.

## Overview
