# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Inno-Setup-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Inno Setup.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Inno Setup-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Inno Setup-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Inno Setup. The original rule was that Inno Setup had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Inno Setup code is included.
