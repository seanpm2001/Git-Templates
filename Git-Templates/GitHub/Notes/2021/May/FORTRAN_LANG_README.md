# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Fortran-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Fortran.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Fortran-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Fortran-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Fortran. The original rule was that Fortran had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Fortran code is included.
