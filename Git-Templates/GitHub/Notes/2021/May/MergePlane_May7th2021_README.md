# Merge Plane session May 6th 2021

I had a short session today and did less merging. The games leaderboard finally broke last time, I knew it would at some point, although it may not be broken, as my other apps weren't detecting my stable Wi-Fi/Cellular data connection either. Android has weird network problems with no good advice on fixes. I feel like it really is really gone for good, as the game hasn't been up for download for about a year now, and all other Internet functionality hasn't existed for a while, plus the leaderboard hasn't been updating since the final update.

## Overview

See above.
