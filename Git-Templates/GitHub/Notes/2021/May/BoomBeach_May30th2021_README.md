# Boom Beach session May 30th 2021

I had a normal length Boom Beach session and made some progress. I currently don't like how difficult it is to upgrade buildings though.

## Main base

I continued to play on my main base today. I was unable to upgrade any buildings today, I am now saving up for a headquarters upgrade, but I will try harder to go through with it this time.

### Submarine

I went for a dive with the submarine that will be ready next week. I received a decent reward from last weeks voyage. I chose to get a better decent reward today.

### Power stones

I converted over 28 power stones today, but didn't place any new statues. I am considering starting to strategize my statue construction.

### Upgrades

I had difficulty doing upgrades today. I wasn't able to do any, and it is really difficult to save up for them. Recent attacks against my base resulted in some loot lost, but not enough to prevent me from getting close to upgrading.

## Battles

I did several battles today.

### Dr Terror Sunday island

I did the first 3 stages of Dr. Terrors Sunday island, and didn't lose any troops on any battles. I didn't go for stage 4 or further, as I wanted to get far and prosperous with the mega crab event.

### Tribal Mega Crab

I completed the first 11 stages of the Tribal Mega Crab today, until I lost my last 3 scorchers on the 12th battle. I received a decent amount of resources.

### Consideration

I am considering letting all bases get reclaimed, so that people stop attacking me every single week, so that I can come back later when I am more advanced and have some easy wins. For now, I have decided to just not attack any players. (Decision started on Sunday, May 9th 2021)

## Overview

See above.
