# Clash of Clans session May 23rd 2021

I had a very long session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 5 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 4 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official last Sunday (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it)

## Main village

I did 1 upgrade in my main village, upgrading my bomb tower to level 2 for 1.5 million gold, as I couldn't afford the 2 million gold upgrades due to multiple successful attacks against my village. I eventually waited out the gearing up of my archer tower, upgraded a few walls, and went back to the builder base.
<!-- See the May 2nd 2021 status post about my decade-long project of getting all my walls to level 9 !-->

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I didn't come too close to the Mega Tesla or Cannon Cart upgrades, so for now, I did a push trap upgrade (MAX level 9)

I used the clock tower boost a bit earlier today, and enjoyed battling. I did my usual 6 battles today.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today, with a mix of 2 skeleton balloons. It works, but isn't always effective because it is too low level. Nevertheless, I still used it today, it is useful in some situations.

## Overview

See above.
