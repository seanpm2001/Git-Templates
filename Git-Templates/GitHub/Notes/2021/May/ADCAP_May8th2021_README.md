# AdVenture Capitalist session May 8th 2021

I played for a bit today, and updated the game before starting both Saturday sessions. I did some collection and upgrades today, but it was a pretty normal tame session.

## Earth

I made some progress with upgrades on Earth, doing over 400 upgrades. I am still saving up angels for the next angel claim.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today.

## Mars

I made minor progress on Mars today.

## Saturday Morning Fever Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, bux, and event token item.

## Overview

See above.
