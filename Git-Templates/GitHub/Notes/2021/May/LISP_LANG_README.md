# GitHub organization: Seanpm2001-Lisp-lang

## Description

My GitHub organization for my projects written in Lisp.

## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Lisp-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Lisp-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Lisp. The original rule was that Lisp had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Lisp code is included.
