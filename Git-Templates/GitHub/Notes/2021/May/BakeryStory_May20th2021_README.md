# Bakery Story session May 20th 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted about 16 minutes. I made 3 batches of coffee (3x8x110) and 1 batch of blueberry muffins (1x10x130)

## Gifts

I received some parts, along with lots of hot chocolate and some cappuchino. I stocked the gifts today.

## Tips

My bakery received dozens of tips while I was gone, and it took a couple minutes to collect all of it. I collected while I was cooking and brewing to save time.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
