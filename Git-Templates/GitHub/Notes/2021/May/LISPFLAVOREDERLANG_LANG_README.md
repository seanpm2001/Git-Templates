## More info

[https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LispFlavoredErlang-lang](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-LispFlavoredErlang-lang)

This organization is used for the showcasing, and development of my projects written in Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE) The original rule was that Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE) had to be the main language, but I changed it so that any project that contains any Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE) code is included.
