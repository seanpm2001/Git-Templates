# Lego Tower session May 20th 2021

I had a normal session today and played for a very long time, doing a lot of collection, elevator trips, vehicle collection, and piece collection. I collected many new rare pieces today, and began construction on my 21st floor. I made over 300 bux today.

## Overview
