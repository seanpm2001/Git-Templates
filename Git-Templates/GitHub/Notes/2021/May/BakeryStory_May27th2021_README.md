# Bakery Story session May 27th 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted less than 10 minutes. I was low on time today, so I played differently, making chocolate chip cookies (5 minutes) instead of blueberry muffins (15 minutes) to save time and play more efficiently. I also made the usual batch of coffee.

## Gifts

I received some parts, along with lots of hot chocolate and some cappuchino. I did not stock the gifts today.

## Tips

My bakery received dozens of tips while I was gone, and it took a couple minutes to collect all of it. I collected while I was cooking and brewing to save time.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
