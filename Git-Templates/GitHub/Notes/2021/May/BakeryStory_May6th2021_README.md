I had a normal session today that lasted about 17 minutes. I only made 2 batches of coffee (2x8x110) and 1 batch of blueberry muffins (1x10x130)

## Gifts

I received some parts, along with 500 plates of hot chocolate.

## Tips

My bakery received dozens of tips while I was gone, and it took a couple minutes to collect all of it.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.
