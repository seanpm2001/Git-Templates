# AdVenture Capitalist session May 22nd 2021

I played for a while today, and made some progress, especially on Earth, where I did an angel claim today.

## Earth

I made some progress with upgrades on Earth, doing an angel claim, and tens of thousands of upgrades.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today.

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, doing a few thousand upgrades.

## 1 percent land Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, and my 4th 1% land badge (or maybe 5th) I played extra, as a hard drive transfer was in progress. I almost got a time warp express as well, but wrapped up, as to not spend more time.

## Overview

See above.
