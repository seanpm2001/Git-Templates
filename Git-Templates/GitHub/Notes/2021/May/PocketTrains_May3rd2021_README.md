# Pocket Trains session May 3rd 2021

I had an extremely long session today, and eventually forced myself to quit. I made significant progress, but got too desperate, and wasted tons of bux.

## New railroads

I built 2 new railroads today, I built the dragonbreath station in Beijing, and a San Juan standard in San Juan. The new dragonbreath station will travel around China, and the San Juan will travel around South America.

## Bux

I tried to save up bux today, but I got desperate and wasted over 200 bux on a medium level bank deal to build 2 new railroads, and unlock some areas.

## Asia exploration

I explored some regions in Asia today, and partially visited some of them.

## South America exploration

I explored several regions in Asia today, and partially visited some of them.

## Africa routing

I am working on re-routing Africa, so my train that reaches the Nordic region of Europe can stop going so far into Africa. I didn't make progresxs on this goal today.

## Revenue

I continued to struggle to make revenue today due to expenses, but I didn't do well on this goal today.

## Overall routing

I put many miles on all my trains today, and wore most of them out before quitting.

## Level up

I did not level up today.

## Overview

See above.
