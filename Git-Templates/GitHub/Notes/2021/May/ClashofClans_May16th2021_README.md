# Clash of Clans session May 16th 2021

I had a normal length session today. I played for a while and started some upgrades, and did my usual 6 battles. I am still considering making this game a daily/bi-daily game (decision started 4 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 18th 2021) and it got stronger 3 Sundays ago (Sunday, April 25th 2021) and became very close to becoming official today (Sunday, May 16th 2021) I am now really considering it)

## Main village

I did 1 upgrade in my main village after doing 1 battle. I wasted hundreds of gems, but came closer to gearing up 3 buildings (in 7 days, I will have 2 geared up buildings) my bliss period of no attacks ended recently, and there were 2 unsuccessful attacks against me, so I decided to do an actual battle today. I didn't come close to the amount I needed, so I spent over 200 gems. They don't really go towards much anyways.

This was my first attack from the main village in several months. I should remain mostly undefeated for a while due to my base, until I get to Gold League or Crystal League, then I am estimating, I will get stronger opponents (the reason my trophy count is so low for my level is that I rarely did attacks in the past and present, and eventually just let people attack me until the majority couldn't successfully destroy 50% or more of my base)

<!-- See the May 2nd 2021 status post about my decade-long project of getting all my walls to level 9 !-->

## Builder base

Today in the builder base, I didn't come too close to the Mega Tesla or Cannon Cart upgrades, I came a little over a 3rd to these goals. For now, the master builder was gearing up a building in the main village, so I couldn't upgrade anything anyway. The main things I like about the builder base are the mechanics of not being able to get robbed by other players, and a unique style of battle, plus new and unique structures.

I used the clock tower boost a bit late today, and enjoyed battling. I did my usual 6 battles today.

### Battles

I did mostly night witch spamming today, but for my final attacks, I tried out the skeleton balloon. It wasn't too helpful, likely because I need a better strategy, and because it is too low level. Nevertheless, I still used it today, it is useful in some situations.

## Overview

See above.
