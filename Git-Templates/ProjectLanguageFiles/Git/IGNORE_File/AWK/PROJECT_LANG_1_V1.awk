# I decided to make AWK the project language file for this project (IGNORE_File/Documentation) as I haven't used AWK yet, and felt like it fits here, as it is another UNIX system utility language.

# File info

# File type: AWK source file (*.awk)
# File version: 1 (Sunday, May 16th 2021 at 9:38 pm)
# Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): 12
