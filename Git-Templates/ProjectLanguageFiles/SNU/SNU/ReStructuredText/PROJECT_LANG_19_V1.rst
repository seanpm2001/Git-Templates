Project language file 19
==============

For seanpm2001/SNU (CORE)
-----------------

I chose ReStructuredText as the 1th project language file for this project, as ReStructuredText is beginning to get used on this project, and it needs its own project language file.

This is an instance in which I am using ReStructuredText as a project language. If you want to do the same for your project, add this to your ``.gitattributes`` file

::

*.rst linguist-detectable=true
*.rst linguist-documentation=false

::

Advanced version:
-----------------

::

    # ReStructuredText (*.rst)
    *.rst linguist-detectable=true
    *.rst linguist-documentation=false

::
