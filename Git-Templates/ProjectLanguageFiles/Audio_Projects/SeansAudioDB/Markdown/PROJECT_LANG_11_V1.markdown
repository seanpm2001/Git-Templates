# Project language file number 11

## For the Seanpm2001 life archive SeansAudioDB database project

The 7th project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/SeansAudioDB/)  is Markdown, as this project uses Markdown significantly in documentation, and I am now including all languages as project language files.

This is a rare instance in which I am using Markdown as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

Extended version:

```gitattributes
# Markdown
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
*.mkd linguist-detectable=true
*.mkd linguist-documentation=false
*.markdown linguist-detectable=true
*.markdown linguist-documentation=false
```
