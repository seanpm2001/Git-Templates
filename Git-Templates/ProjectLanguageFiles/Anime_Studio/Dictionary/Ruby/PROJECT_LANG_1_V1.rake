# About:
# I chose Ruby as the first project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Anime_Studio_Dictionary) as Ruby is a programming language of Japanese origin that is very good in web development. This project is merely a documentation set, a dictionary application, and can be written in Ruby for web portions, and for content. It also pairs well with Jekyll for when Markdown is needed. It will be paired with Raku for scripting and further configuration. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
