# Project language file 1

## For Anime_Studio/Docs

I chose Markdown as the first project language file for this project (Anime_Studio/Docs) as this project is just documentation for Anime Studio, of which the documentation is mainly written in Markdown. Markdown is getting its own project language file, starting here.

This is an instance in which I am using Markdown as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
*.md linguist-language=Markdown
```

Advanced version:

```gitattributes
# Markdown (*.md, *.mkd, *.mdown, *.markdown)
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
*.md linguist-language=Markdown
*.mkd linguist-detectable=true
*.mkd linguist-documentation=false
*.mkd linguist-language=Markdown
*.mdown linguist-detectable=true
*.mdown linguist-documentation=false
*.mdown linguist-language=Markdown
*.markdown linguist-detectable=true
*.markdown linguist-documentation=false
*.markdown linguist-language=Markdown
```
