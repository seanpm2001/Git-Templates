# Project language file

## For Seanpm2001/Medicinal-Ethics

The project language file for this project is Markdown, as this project (Medicinal Ethics) is an article/documentation project written in Markdown.

This is a rare instance in which I am using Markdown as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)

```gitattributes
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
```

Extended:

```gitattributes
# Markdown
*.md linguist-detectable=true
*.md linguist-documentation=false
*.mkd linguist-detectable=true
*.mkd linguist-documentation=false
*.markdown linguist-detectable=true
*.markdown linguist-documentation=false
```
