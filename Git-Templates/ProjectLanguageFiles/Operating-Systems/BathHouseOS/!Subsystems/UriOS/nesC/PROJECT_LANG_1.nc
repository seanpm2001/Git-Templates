  * For: BathHouseOS : UriOS
  * About:
  * I decided to make nesC the 1st project language file for this project (BathHouseOS: UriOS) as the core system (TinyOS) is written mostly
  in nesC, and I wanted to use it for better system interaction, and for software diversity reasons. A urinal shouldn't be too complicated, 
  and the language design should sync with the OS family, so there is no need to choose a more advanced language.
