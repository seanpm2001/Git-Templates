# Contributing.md

Contributions currently aren't allowed here. This is a personal project for my journaling archive, and I don't need too much help other than suggestions. I have this under control.

**However, there is something I need help with on this project:**

I am working on curating the NimbleBit category on GitHub, this is why I created this repo, as it is one of the 27 NimbleBit games (As of November 25th 2020) I don't have any sources or ways of seeing images/playing this game. Any help with this, along with valid image contributions are allowed, just send a pull request and ask.
