# CONTRIBUTING

Contributing to SNU 2D programming tools is easy to do if you are experienced. This repository is planned to be written in every programming language. For development, you can choose which language you want to work on, but you should also have some background HTML, CSS, and JS or PHP experience.

This is an upload of a module from a local directory.

## Modify

> * You can modify each terminal center. The purpose of these is to emulate programming in various languages, even archaic ones, such as B, FORTRAN II, etc. The pages currently need modifications so that programming can be done via a web browser. 

> * High ranking contributers that are certified by [seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) are allowed to modify home pges

> * Home pages for different languages can be modified, but they have to follow the theme, remain fast and efficient, and serve their purpose

## Don't modify

> * Some sections should not be modified. For example, DO NOT MODIFY SUB REPOSITORIES. Do not modify any files in this path:
`//Programming Tools/!Repositories!/SNU/`

> * Do not modify snapshot files. Snpapshot files are used to archive old versions of pages. They are not to be modified.
Snapshot files end with `snapshot1`, `snapshot2`, etc. or `V1`, `V2`, etc.

> * Do not modify the software center pages, this page is no longer used here, it is part of a different project, it just serves legacy purposes.

> * Do not modify the license file

> * Only the repository owner [(seanpm2001)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) can modify the `README.md` file, the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, and the `LICENSE.md` files.
